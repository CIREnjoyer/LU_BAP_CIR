IRISH RAIL has responded to pressure from campaigners and will replace and upgrade lifts at all Dart and commuter rail stations over the next five years. 

“This is an amazing victory for the disabled community. Their right to access to public transport has finally been recognized” said Bernard Mulvany, co-coordinator with Sean O’Kelly of the Access for All Campaign

On one day in November, Access for All Ireland said there were 11 Dart stations where lifts were out of order. Recently, the campaign had seen that the out-of-service lifts was getting worse at Dart stations.

Today Bernard Mulvany, who is a candidate for People before Profit in Dublin Bay North said:

“This proves that campaigning works. It is the only way to get change. Irish Rail had no regard for accessibility to their trains. They would have got away with it for ever had our campaign not reminded them every day that people were suffering as a result of this”

A tender issued by the company this week outlines plans to install 28 new lifts and upgrade a further 112 lifts across Irish Rail’s network between 2020 and 2024. 

Irish Rail have committed to the following upgrades.28 new heavy-duty, stainless steel lifts will be installed at 19 stations.112 lifts at 58 stations will be upgraded with new operating systems. And new escalators will be installed at Pearse, Connolly and Dún Laoghaire.

It is estimated that lift upgrade works over the next five years will cost €12 million. 

Irish Rail says it will have a contractor in place for upgrade works by this summer with works due to commence later this year.","277","https://www.facebook.com/peoplebeforeprofitofficial/posts/pfbid02VaGVxfYTqMe8axYovWEGVvRm6mZcVj78PrGN7KtfkF5QBEnGsaHHsiggYzaDp72il"

The audio aid ballot for the visually impaired for Dublin South Central was issued and one of the names of a sitting TDs, Brid Smith, was excluded.

In a statement, Barney Doherty, campaign manager for Brid Smith said:

“This is an affront to democracy. Leaving out the name of a sitting TD on a ballot paper for the visually impaired indicates either gross negligence or unconscious bias.

“I have been informed by the Dublin City Returning Officer that the production of this paper was outsourced to a private company.

“This omission is a deep insult to the visually impaired community as well as an affront to the democratic process itself.

“I am calling on the returning officer to take responsibility. They should make a public statement on the matter and explain how they intend to rectify the situation.”","284","https://www.facebook.com/peoplebeforeprofitofficial/posts/pfbid0AwrUn8VLk5Lnb5bjQn5Y6yp4EkgfFqZgMFnqcTEbBgxQvPLyu3AQf5Qk95YESSZsl"

VOTE NO 1 PEOPLE BEFORE PROFIT AND TRANSFER LEFT

We could have Ireland’s first left government – with Fine Gael or Fianna Fail gone. That is what all the polls are telling us.

People Before Profit will strongly support the election of Ireland’ first left government.

But we are the only party in this election that is ruling out supporting any coalition with Fianna Fail or Fine Gael.

We have appealed to the Greens, Social Democrats and Sinn Fein to rule it out – but they will not do so. Their leaders have all said they are willing to vote for a FF or FG Taoiseach – if they can strike the right deal.

But once you join the right wing in government you are locked into a system of ‘cabinet responsibility’. This means you must stand over the decisions made by a FF or FG Taoiseach. There is no way out of this.

If the polls are correct, the prospect of a coalition of Fianna Fail with either the Greens, Labour or Social Democrats is a real possibility.

So too, in certain circumstances, is one with SF, despite what Micheal Martin says today.

The best way to Break the Cycle of endless FF/FG rule is to vote NO 1 for People Before Profit and transfer your No 2s and No 3s to other left candidates.","65","https://www.facebook.com/peoplebeforeprofitofficial/posts/pfbid0tCeW2ajRKcoLSzFkb795g4kwpiQouZy6YpVjfgDkHDWMVqvKqPqm1ehDoP5GKKBql"

To achieve this we have to tackle the large-scale private ownership and hoarding of wealth in society.

There are 17 billionaires with a combined total wealth of €40 billion in Irish society. This is frankly unacceptable when you have a housing crisis, a healthcare crisis and a looming environmental catastrophe.

We need socialist fighters in the Dáil to link up with social and industrial movements for radical change. This is what's necessary to transform Irish society.","10","https://www.facebook.com/solidarityie/posts/pfbid0J3ghLPbTdBNNocp6FqukindmZKBrJQ6TNJiRb138ujYBWLmCbpcJupELdxjZDeU8l"

Yet some would appear to be of the belief that science will come up with a Flash Gordon kind of solution to save the planet just as the clock counts down to midnight,"" he writes.

""The Green Party does not have a monopoly on how to tackle climate change - however, there is a growing chasm between how serious the party is taking the issue and the apparent disregard of three big parties for tackling what is officially designated as an emergency.""

Ireland needs a sustainable housing strategy to tackle the housing crisis.

Secondary students from across the country are leaving schools to join protests across the country today. They have every right to do so – their future is being threatened by hypocritical politicians who talk ‘concern’ but do little.
Ireland has one of the worst records in Europe – as a direct result of policies pursued by Fine Gael and Fianna Fail.
They are:

• Proceeding with an extra runway at Dublin Airport;
• Continuing to pursue international data centres that consume vast quantities of electricity;
• Continuing to subsidise peat production with high Co2 emissions;
• Supporting the construction of Liquefied Natural Gas Terminals at Shannon and
• Cork that will house massive quantities of fracked North American gas;
• Continuing to issue exploration licences to oil and gas companies;
• Blocking People Before Profit’s Bill to keep fossil fuels in the ground;
• Continuing to increase the beef and dairy herds in line with Harvest 2025.

To save our planet we need radical action. We need free public transport to get people out of cars. We need to impose an immediate ban on exploring for fossil fuels. We need a major state led retro-fitting programme to create green jobs by insulating homes.
Saving the climate is about more than choosing a colour. In this election, it has become obvious that the Green Party will join a government led by Fianna Fail.
That will do little to tackle the climate crisis. We need to Break the Cycle of endless FF/FG rule. That means voting NO 1 for People Before Profit.

On tonight's #RTELeadersDebate, Eamon Ryan stated the Green Party's red line issue: tackling the climate and biodiversity crises and doing it a way that benefits our society. ""Warmer homes, better transport, our own energy supply. Tackling the health and housing crisis as we do it, creating social justice with ecological justice. That's the big crisis, that's what we have to address.""

💶 Introduce a system of regional public banking that supports small businesses and rural Ireland. 
🏠 Reintroduce an 80% windfall tax on rezoned land to reduce the cost of housing.
🏚️ Increase the vacant site levy and implement a site value tax to tackle land hoarding and promote housing completions.
🧓 Implement a new Commission on Tax and Social Welfare to ensure fairness in pensions and the provision of a living wage.
🔟 Pursue a wealth tax on individuals holding assets over €10 million.
🔬 Introduce research and development tax incentives for Small and Medium Enterprises and Irish research institutions. 
🏛️ Reform public procurement to include SMEs.

🏠 Major investment in deep retrofitting Ireland's public and private housing stock, to tackle emissions, cut household bills, and eliminate fuel poverty.
0️⃣ A zero-carbon mandate so that by 2022 all Irish new builds will be designed and constructed to zero carbon standard.
👨‍👩‍👧‍👧 Better planned, centrally located homes to deliver essential services and infrastructure - building not just homes, but communities.
💧 Rainwater harvesting in all new buildings to save valuable resources. 
👷‍♂️ Skills training for all trades to encourage low-carbon construction methods.
🌍 Climate change mitigation at the heart of all new developments to prevent flooding and overheating.

Let's build housing now that's fit for the future.

Gardai authorities have informed school students from Fridays for Future that they will not ‘facilitate’ their protest in Dublin.

They claimed that a ‘planned route is highly dangerous and is not recommended’

They also complained a previous protest been infiltrated by an “outside organisation which could have had serious consequences had the Gardaí not intervened”.

This ‘outside’ organisation was not named.

This is a disgraceful and patronising way to treat young people. If Gardai had problem with a particular route, they could easily have simply contacted the organisers with a suggestion for an alternative.

The political establishment thought that the student protest was a ‘once -off’. But as it continues, it's clear they  are worried that it is becoming more radical.

We could have Ireland’s first left government – with Fine Gael or Fianna Fail gone. That is what all the polls are telling us. Their combined vote is less that 45%.

A left government could tackle the housing crisis by building tens of thousands of homes on public land. It could freeze rent. It could open the thousands of hospital beds. It could restore the pension age to 65. It could make Ireland a model on how to tackle climate change –rather than facing EU fines for inaction.

People Before Profit will strongly support the election of Ireland’ first left government.  

But we are the only party in this election that is ruling out supporting any coalition with Fianna Fail or Fine Gael.
We have appealed to the Greens, Social Democrats and Sinn Fein to rule it out – but they will not do so. Their leaders have all said they are willing to vote for a FF or FG Taoiseach – if they can strike the right deal. 

But once you join the right wing in government you are  locked into a system of ‘cabinet responsibility’. This means you must stand over the decisions made by a FF or FG Taoiseach.  There is no way out of this.

If the polls are correct, the prospect off a coalition of Fianna Fail with either the Greens, Labour or Social Democrats  is a real possibility. So too, in certain circumstances, is one with SF, despite what Micheal Martin says today.

The best way to Break the Cycle of endless FF/FG rule is to vote NO 1 for People Before Profit and transfer your No 2s and No 3s to other left candidates.","449","https://www.facebook.com/peoplebeforeprofitofficial/posts/pfbid0L2nvp15v8T7n7toQfbeYEvFGZqSgx49x2mjzEJvVqQ8mRkreLinTqYnuYBgtJqyrl"

Banks are fleecing many homeowners, forcing mortgage holders to pay an extra €42,000 a year. Here is how it works.

If you borrow money from a European bank, you pay interest at an average rate of 1.5% on your loan.

But Irish banks charge double that, taking an interest of 3% per year.

This means that each month a homeowner is paying an extra €175 a month to the banks.

Over the twenty-year lifetime of their mortgage, that amounts to an extra €42,000. If you are on a 30-year mortgage, you are paying an extra €63,000.  That is two years salary for the average person!

This is exorbitant robbery- sanctioned by Fianna Fail and Fine Gael.

They are also letting banks away with paying no tax for the next ten year  - while they make an annual profit of €2.5 billion a year.

People Before Profit wants to change all this. We will

1.       Bring in a law to insist that banks cannot charge double the European rate.

2.       Immediately impose a minimum corporations tax rate on them.

3.       Take them into public ownership so that cheap credit is available to Irish society.","627","https://www.facebook.com/peoplebeforeprofitofficial/posts/pfbid0d1ebWReQKoaPt411j22iG9Z69eWYNHN4WX45jcA4QuiWJN8ghtgukX4xMxVLK6epl"

""The critical issue of our time is climate change. The Green Party's investment in transport, in the retrofitting of houses, the way we will work with farmers, the re-wilding of nature, ALL of these policies - better homes, better communities, proper planning, proper transport, they would actually be the measures required to combat climate change.

They would reduce emissions, provide a better, more resilient economy, and we would have a better country.""

I'm not writing an IOU to my three children saying I'm giving that bill to you in 2030.”

If we stick with the status quo, these are the fines that are coming down the track. The Green Party wants to invest that money now to increase access to affordable housing, improve public transport infrastructure and protect our environment.  

The Green Party is the only party prepared to provide leadership on climate action. Other parties are shunning responsibility and burying their heads in the sand.

Too many night-time venues and clubs have closed in the last few years, only to be bulldozed to make way for grey hotels or office blocks.

Local councils must support more performances and exhibitions in public spaces - they should protect existing spaces from greedy developers too. 

To make matters worse, our archaic licensing laws strangle the life out of nightlife. Clubs and other venues close earlier in Dublin than they do anywhere else in Europe. Not only does this deny people the opportunity to access music and entertainment on their terms, it fuels other problems too - like anyone who has seen the city centre after 3AM will attest to. It makes no sense to close all the clubs in the city at once.

We should follow the lead of the Give Us The Night campaign, which calls for positive changes to our night-life.

For working people, the hours in the evening after work are when we are free to enjoy arts and culture but most venues are closed. Galleries, theatres and other cultural spaces should offer late-night openings to better accommodate working people.

The arts and culture belong to the people - let's fund them properly and make them accessible to all!","222","https://www.facebook.com/peoplebeforeprofitofficial/posts/pfbid0pAVyrpwX4DtwqgrEmVMFQgrTW9oropzeDtshHr216bneytGbAjAM6ruW1on8aZ7pl"

But with Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael both now supporting the project, Ireland may soon become a key entry point for US fracked gas into the EU, tying us into decades more fossil fuel dependency.

The enormous, irreversible damage caused by fracking cannot be overlooked for short-sighted economic gain.

To protect the environment we must think globally and act locally. 

Other parties have demonstrated that they can’t be trusted to put environmental issues top of the agenda. Only Green policies will provide Green solutions.

We must halt the loss of our biodiversity and protect, restore, and help nature thrive. The Green Party will:

🌳 Use forestry grants to grow Ireland's tree cover from 11% to 30% by 2030.
🦋 Tighten restrictions on the harmful use of pesticides and insecticides. 
🧪 Set up systems to monitor our air and marine ecosystems and address high levels of pollution.
🐬 Make 50% of Irish waters conservation areas. 
🐝 Support the roll-out of the National Pollinator Plan to promote and protect insect biodiversity. 
💧Carry out a major programme of peatland restoration and rewetting.
🌿 Legislate to protect our hedgerows and peatlands from destruction. 
⚖️ Grant stronger enforcement powers to the Environmental Protection Agency
🚜 Reform payments to farmers to encourage nature-friendly farming. 
💶 Increase funding for the National Parks and Wildlife Service and other conservation groups, so they have the resources to protect our natural world.
🥤 Reduce waste in our environment by implementing our Waste Reduction Bill to reduce single-use plastics and
🍾 Introduce a deposit-and-return scheme for bottles - just like in Germany.

He has confirmed that Mary Lou McDonald will accept the invitation.

He said:

""I want to welcome the decision by RTÉ to extend an invite to Mary Lou McDonald to take part in tomorrow’s party leaders’ debate on Prime Time, and I am happy to confirm that Mary Lou will be participating.

""That being said, this should not have come down to a last minute decision on the part of RTÉ.

""Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil wanted this election to be about them, but this election was never about two parties with no real policy differences, who have effectively been in government together for the last four years. Neither of them represent change.

""This election is about the Irish people and our future.

""Sinn Féin are the real voice of change in this election and are the only party that is committed to giving workers and families a break.

""In the final days of the election campaign, I am appealing to voters to come out on Saturday and vote for Sinn Féin"".","2918","https://www.facebook.com/sinnfein/posts/pfbid034kYryfyPhsbJGWeK2NwV2osZmo6mAH4EuWCSCqxx8ghijMvATyTLBYrCb2pVAEbcl"

The Irish model of childcare is broken.

We have the dearest childcare costs in Europe – but some of the worst paid staff.

There is a huge staff turnover, with one survey indicating that two thirds of staff will not continue to work in the sector if the situation does not change.

On top of all that there are problems with insurance and how TUSLA regulations are implemented.

There are two main reasons why there is a crisis:

Ireland lags behind the rest of Europe in its underfunding of childcare. The Irish governments spends just 0.2% of its GDP on childcare – the European average is four times higher.

The Irish model is based on private small businesses – whereas in many other countries there is a public not-for-profit system.

If we address both these issues, we could ensure that costs for parents could drop significantly – and that childcare staff would get a living wage.

Here is what People Before Profit proposes:

Increase investment in childcare services by €800 million immediately. Pay for it through taxes on billionaires, big corporations and vulture funds.

Guarantee each child 33 hours free care in an expanded system.

Over time, integrate privately run creches into a publicly run system of childcare.

Childcare education has never been taken seriously in Ireland because it was assumed that women would stay at home to look after children. When this ethos broke down, the Irish state made little effort to develop a proper childcare system.

Fine Gael and Fianna Fail are ideologically opposed to developing a public system. They know it would mean higher taxes on the wealthy – and so the legacy of their rule is underfunded public services.

Nobody suggests that a child aged 4 is not entitled to free, state run education.

The union is entirely right to strike in response to the failure of the government to address pay inequality, which is creating real hardship for young teachers.

Schools are facing real difficulties in recruiting teachers due to the low starting salaries. 

PBP is calling on parents and students to give full support to the teachers and lecturers who will be on strike.

We fully support he teachers in their fight for equal pay.

Young teachers are staring on salaries 14% lower than they would have if they had started in 2011.  

Within the first ten years of their career, they will earn over €50,000 less. Over a 40-year career, they earn over €110,000 less.

All political parties who have been in power since 2010 are responsible for this discrimination against young teachers.

Despite promises, the government has failed to address this discrimination and clearly, the TUI has lost patience. 

We welcome the fact that the ASTI has agreed to ballot for similar action. A sustained campaign of action can lead to the achievement of equal pay.

No trade union can tolerate a situation where two workers doing the same work are paid different rates of pay.

PBP TDs proposed motions in the Dail to end unequal pay but were blocked by the government using the so called “money message”.

All parties must now declare that they will support the immediate abolition of the two  tier pay system.

The government must give a commitment that no sanctions will be taken against striking TUI members arising from the Public Service Pay and Pension Act.

This legislation represents an attack on trade union rights and the right to strike.  PBP will make the repeal of such legislation a priority in the new Dail.","174","https://www.facebook.com/peoplebeforeprofitofficial/posts/pfbid0rnJXPmfMLF6qnSXXs9Y147b2ncEo2KFKsEmcaXqA2q97TiATKHdtRJ8is3pTkn3ql"

⚖️ Supporting the principles of Universal Basic Income so that caring work is valued and rewarded.
💶 Raising the basic rate of payment of Carer’s Allowance and promoting carer-led service provision to ensure that the most appropriate services and supports are put in place
🔄 Introducing refundable tax credits to support people in mixing work in the paid economy with work in the unpaid economy.
👶 Increasing child benefit in line with inflation to make sure it continues to help parents into the future.
👨‍👧‍👦Restoring the age limit for the One-Parent Family Payment from 7 to 18 years inclusive, or until a child has left second-level education.
🇪🇺 Bringing Ireland into line with the EU average for childcare payments through subsidies and caps on cost.
👵 Supporting pensioners who are carers by merging the contributory and non-contributory State pensions into a single, universal pension.

💻 Ensuring HSE disability assessments are started within three months of an application being made, and completed within three months. 
👩‍🎓Establishing a comprehensive framework for early education professionals to ensure childcare workers are incentivised to stay in the sector after graduation.

People Before Profit will demand: 

1. A Living Wage of €15 an hour 
• End the scandal of low pay • Ireland has the third-highest incidence of low pay in the EU 

2. Equal pay for equal work 
• End the discrimination against new entrants to the public service 
• Close the gender pay gap 

3. The right to retire on a full pension at 65 
• Reverse the increase in the pension age 

4. Increase holidays to the European average• On average European workers get 33.8 days off per year • In high-income countries the average is 34.7 • In Ireland we get 28 

5. Protection from dismissal from day 1 in employment 
• Ireland is almost bottom of the league for the protection of workers against dismissal; • The Unfair Dismissal Act requires, with some exceptions, that employees to be in work for at least a year 

6. A reduction in the working week 
• Irish workers work in excess of EU average hours 
• In high-income countries, the average hours are 120 less per year 
• France has a 35 hour week; Finland is moving to a 4 day week 

7. Full employment rights for migrant works 
• Migrants Right Centre research shows almost half of migrant workers receive less than the minimum wage, almost half have no contract and two-thirds are required to work extra hours without pay 

8. End precarious employment 
• Outlaw “If and When Contracts” • A financial penalty for companies over-reliant on temporary contracts • End bogus self-employment 

9. Mandatory Sick Pay on Full Rates of Pay • Ireland is one of five EU countries where sick pay is not “state-mandated” 
• Replacement levels (the amount of your earnings covered) by sick benefit is 36%, the third-lowest in the EU 

10. Mandatory Maternity Pay on Full Rates of Pay 
• Irish women are not legally entitled to any period of “well-paid” maternity leave. • In only three OECD countries,
The UK, USA, and Ireland is statutory maternity pay less than 35% of normal pay • Paternity and parental leave should also be paid at the full rate 

11. Mandatory union recognition • Ireland has one of the most restrictive collective bargaining legislation compared to other European countries and even further afield • Ireland has one of the lowest levels of Collective Bargaining coverage in the EU 

12. The Right to Strike • Repeal the 1990 Industrial Relations Act to allow for secondary action and the right to take strike action on political issues such as housing • Repeal the Public Services Pay and Pension Act 2017 and FEMPI legislation to remove sanctions against public sector workers who go on strike.","471","https://www.facebook.com/peoplebeforeprofitofficial/posts/pfbid0b2S45r3Gje8iK8P7z19xumn4q69ZmUfnGbVdHR4TdaEKEhNJDJ9uPJdMTiNk9FiXl"

With your vote, we want to deliver: 

📖 A new National Housing Plan to replace Fine Gael's failed 'Rebuilding Ireland' strategy. 
🗳️ A referendum on establishing a right to housing. 
🏗️ Public housing built on public land to alleviate the housing crisis. 
👨‍👨‍👧‍👦 Better planned, centrally located homes to deliver essential services and infrastructure - building not just homes, but communities. 
🏘️ Cost rental housing - 'the Vienna model' - to drive down rents and provide warm, healthy homes that offer a real alternative to the private market. 
💪 Stronger renters rights, to guarantee fair rent, security of tenure, and swift resolution of disputes through a better-resourced Rental Tenancies Board. 
⚖️ Enforcement of existing rent pressure zones to stabilise rents. 
🔆 Major investment in deep retrofitting Ireland's public and private housing stock, to tackle emissions, cut household bills, and eliminate fuel poverty. 
🔁 A zero-carbon mandate so that by 2022 all Irish new builds will be designed and constructed to zero carbon standard.

👬🚶‍♂️👭🏃‍♂️🕺🤸‍♂️👫
Other parties think we can tackle the problems in our society one by one - they see climate and nature loss as issues that are separate from housing, separate from transport, separate from farming. 🏡 Only the Green Party understands that building better housing IS climate action. 👩‍🌾 Getting a better deal for our farmers IS climate action. 🚌 Improving our transport system IS climate action.
💚 💪🌍
The Green Decade is about doing the things we need to do to improve our society now, but doing them with an eye to the future so we make our communities, stronger, more resilient, and ready to rise to any challenge we face. 🏋️‍♂️💪

So far People Before Profit is the only party that completely rules out coalition with the right-wing parties.

We need other parties to do the same.

Vote PBP. Your vote will put real effective fighters for all working people in the Dáil.

➡️ Create a National Cultural Fund to increase state funding of the arts to the European average of 0.6 percent of GDP;

➡️ Fund access to arts participation in disadvantaged areas for adults and children and those with disabilities;

➡️ Open schools and colleges for after-school artistic activities for children and teenagers;

➡️ Open public spaces for use by local arts organisations;

➡️ Support live music. Live music venues are a vital part of our cultural life. We will cut rates on pubs that have regular live music;

➡️ Support performances and exhibitions in public spaces;

➡️ Create arts participation programmes in prisons, schools, care homes and hospitals;

➡️ Remove the requirement of ‘availability for work’ for artists on Jobseeker’s Allowance;

➡️ Create a ‘new deal’ programme for artists in the public sector. This would create well-paid jobs and increase access to the arts throughout society.","87","https://www.facebook.com/peoplebeforeprofitofficial/posts/pfbid02SfyYVb8s4FhPN7VpvwWv1VNsUegtD9fGhdqkG8RBWF7zjeLq8MwBAyB2vRtvxQ8Cl"

🏠🚶‍♀️🏘👨‍👦‍👦🏡👫
We want to replace Fine Gael's failed 'Rebuilding Ireland' strategy with a National Housing Plan that would build public housing on public land and embrace a cost-rental model to increase availability, drive down rents, and provide secure, warm, healthy homes that give people a real alternative to the private rental market.

""In Dublin alone, there is room for more than 20,000 residential units inside the city,"" says our Dublin Central candidate Neasa Hourigan. ""This is close to twice the number of people in emergency accommodation and could go a long way to clear social housing waiting lists.""

Time spent in gridlock is stripping away quality of life, and rural communities are trapped in car-dependancy. The Green Party can fix this.

Yet the government refuses to ban smoky coal nationwide because of legal threats from the coal industry. Under capitalism, the ""right"" to profit takes precedence over our human right to health and preventing catastrophic climate change. 

That's why RISE supports banning smoky coal and a just transition to renewable energy as part of much a much wider transition from capitalism to a democratically planned green socialist economy. 

We need a Green New Deal with socialist policies and we need it now!

She was in the forefront of the movement to Repeal the 8th Amendment, and helped to achieve the provision for terminations up to 12 weeks on request. She is calling for massive public investment in public housing, achievable through taxation of the billionaires and multinationals that are hoarding the wealth in Ireland. She is also calling for real rent controls and an end to economic evictions .

Also, the programme she puts forward on climate change is drastic and could make an impact. She calls to ban imported fracked gas, and to publicly fund free and expanded public transport, which – more than carbon taxes – would drastically reduce the need for people to drive privately-owned cars to and from work.'","14","https://www.facebook.com/solidarityie/posts/pfbid02ER1zSDp3NHAgRtj1QdEk1XK5M59TQSWJBSXyoutLjN8ga8Puz8cKsMP5xioeUfEql"

This is our message for Ireland.

Broadcast this evening on RTÉ One, this is the party political broadcast for this election for the Social Democrats. 

It shows how we want to change Ireland for the better – better transport, better work/life balance, better public healthcare. We talk about policies which are greener and fairer too, and speak about our plans for a national rent freeze and delivering 100,000 new homes on public land.

A team of 20 Social Democrats candidates are standing across Ireland. We need a team of strong, effective and progressive TD’s to join @roisinRóisín Shortall and @Catherine Murphy TD in the Dáil, so we're asking for your support and your number 1 vote on February 8th.

The TomTom Traffic Index for 2019 has today listed Dublin as the most congested city in Western Europe, and the 17th most congested city in the world. And the government's solution? Build more roads.

Today, our transport spokesperson Patrick Costello launched our Transport Policy, which laid out a vision for an alternative transport future - not just for Ireland, but for all of Europe. 

""We’ve had a transport minister for the past three years with no interest in doing anything about Dublin's gridlock - bar building more roads,"" said Cllr. Costello. ""What’s needed is a radical rebalancing of priorities, supporting lots of different ways of getting about the city, rewarding and making it safe to cycle, walk, take public transport, and use other options that will help people get off our roads when they can.”","74","https://www.facebook.com/GreenPartyIreland/posts/pfbid02atZw42oLTbaA5DUAyVhxzPbYmVJxt75Y5oYHi2tgYxLRDD8TBepkYW7DY4CFZ8B1l"

✔️ Under FF, State will subsidise this by over 40% putting money in parents pockets.
✔️ Introduce a new €2000 per year tax credit for workers whose child is being minded by a registered child minder – equivalent to €166 per month.
✔️ Extend the successful ECCE scheme, introduced originally by Fianna Fáil for 3 to 5 year olds by 2 weeks per year to 40 weeks.

But People before Profit do things differently. We want to seriously shake things up. 

We were approached by a group of young voters to hold this public meeting on Saturday-  to hear their concerns, their hopes for the future, and the kind of society they want.

This Saturday 3pm at the Royal Marine in Dun laoghaire, is your space to air your thoughts, your hopes, your gripes, and what YOU WANT for your future.

Tuigimid gur daoine, teaghlaigh agus pobail atá thíos le liostaí feithimh a bheith níos faide ná mar a bhí riamh cheana, tithe inacmhainne a bheith gann agus costais a bheith ag ardú.

John 'Jackie' Duddy - age 17. Shot as he ran away from soldiers in the car park of Rossville Flats. The bullet struck him in the shoulder and entered his chest. Three witnesses said they saw a soldier take deliberate aim at the youth as he ran. He was the first fatality on Bloody Sunday.

Michael Kelly - age 17. Shot in the stomach while standing at the rubble barricade on Rossville Street.

Hugh Gilmour - age 17. Shot as he ran away from soldiers near the rubble barricade. The bullet went through his left elbow and entered his chest.

William Nash - age 19. Shot in the chest at the rubble barricade. Three people were shot while going to his aid, including his father Alexander Nash.

John Young - age 17. Shot in the face at the rubble barricade while crouching and going to the aid of William Nash.

Michael McDaid - age 20. Shot in the face at the rubble barricade, while crouching and going to the aid of William Nash.

Kevin McElhinney - age 17. Shot from behind, near the rubble barricade, while attempting to crawl to safety.

James 'Jim' Wray - age 22. Shot in the back while running away from soldiers in Glenfada Park. He was then shot again in the back as he lay mortally wounded on the ground. Jim Wray was calling out that he could not move his legs before he was shot the second time.

William McKinney - age 27. Shot in the back as he attempted to flee through Glenfada Park.

Gerard McKinney - age 35. Shot in the chest at Abbey Park. A soldier ran through an alleyway from Glenfada Park and shot him from a few yards away. Witnesses said that when he saw the soldier, McKinney stopped and held up his arms, shouting ""Don't shoot! Don't shoot!"", before being shot. The bullet went through his body and struck Gerard Donaghy behind him.

Gerard Donaghy - age 17. Shot in the stomach at Abbey Park while standing behind Gerard McKinney. Both were struck by the same bullet. Bystanders brought Donaghy to a nearby house, where he was examined by a doctor. The doctor opened Donaghy's clothes to examine him, and his pockets were also searched for identification. Two bystanders then attempted to drive Donaghy to hospital, but the car was stopped at an Army checkpoint. They were ordered to leave the car and a soldier drove it to a Regimental Aid Post, where an Army medical officer pronounced Donaghy dead. Soldiers planted nail bombs on Donaghy to justify the killings.

Patrick Doherty - age 31. Shot from behind while attempting to crawl to safety in the forecourt of Rossville Flats. He was shot by soldiers who came out of Glenfada Park. Doherty was photographed, moments before and after he died, by French journalist Gilles Peress. Despite testimony from ""Soldier F"" that he had shot a man holding a pistol, Widgery acknowledged that the photographs show Doherty was unarmed, and that forensic tests on his hands for gunshot residue proved negative.

Bernard 'Barney' McGuigan - age 41. Shot in the head when he walked out from cover to help Patrick Doherty. He had been waving a white handkerchief to indicate his peaceful intentions.

John Johnston - age 59. Shot in the leg and left shoulder on William Street 15 minutes before the rest of the shooting started. Johnston was not on the march, but on his way to visit a friend in Glenfada Park. He died on 16 June 1972; his death has been attributed to the injuries he received on the day. He was the only one not to die immediately or soon after being shot.

We'll never forget.

- The fight for justice continues.","477","https://www.facebook.com/peoplebeforeprofitofficial/posts/pfbid02gDdexM4Rud4KVKFv8NgUS86kJ9vQL413dqjYwAjv95ke7vy4kZJ3fk67W3JMwQYul"

The union is entirely right to strike in response to the failure of the government to address pay inequality, which is creating real hardship for young teachers.

Schools are facing real difficulties in recruiting teachers due to the low starting salaries. 

PBP is calling on parents and students to give full support to the teachers and lecturers who will be on strike.

All political parties who have been in power since 2010 are responsible for this discrimination against young teachers.

Despite promises, the government has failed to address this discrimination and clearly, the TUI has lost patience. 

We welcome the fact that the ASTI has agreed to ballot for similar action.  A sustained campaign of action can lead to the achievement of equal pay.

No trade union can tolerate a situation where two workers doing the same work are paid different rates of pay.

PBP TDs proposed motions in the Dail to end unequal pay but were blocked by the government using the so called “money message”.

All parties must now declare that they will support the immediate abolition of the two tier pay system.

1. Support billions of euros of our money leaving the country - to go to bankers and bondholders!
2. Voted for Eoghan Murphy, who's overseen an explosion in homelessness
3. Voted to understaff our health services
4. Voted with the landlords to keep evicting people

As opposed to the ridiculous ""billions"" Grealish mentioned, the remittances to Nigeria were €17m last year - but whose business is it if working class people want to support their families?

🌱🌳🐛
Today we took our Green campaign to beautiful Bull Island to launch our biodiversity policy. Ireland is in the midst of a biodiversity emergency. We must take urgent action to halt the loss of diversity in our bio systems, we must RESTORE, PROTECT, and HELP NATURE THRIVE.
🌿🐝🐌
Bull Island is a National Bird Sanctuary, a Biosphere reserve, a National Nature Reserve, and a Special Area of Conservation under the EU Habitats Directive, but it faces immense pressures from issues like plastic pollution, rising sea levels and poor water qualitiy, and its bird populations are threatened by over fishing. 
🕊️🐟🐚
Protecting nature matters. Vote Green on February 8th, because looking after nature is looking after ourselves.

Irish banks are engaged in a massive scam to rob customers by charging exorbitant interest rates.

Last year, the head of the Central Bank, Philip Lane, reported that banks had paid out a staggering €120 million in compensation to mortgage holders who were pushed off tracker rates.

These tie interest rates on mortgages to the current very low rates being charged by the European Central Bank.

Yet despite this acknowledgement of massive fraud, AIB continued to charge the ‘wrong’ tracker rate to customers, extracting an extra €500 from them.

The Central bank has acknowledged that over 10,000 mortgage holders have been charged the wrong tracker rate.

There has been no reported case of the ‘mistaken’ rate being to the advantage of the customer.

Mortgage holders who have a variable mortgage are even in a worse position.

These are charged a 3.35 percent interest rate on their mortgages while the equivalent interest rate in the euro area is 1.83 per cent.

On a €200,000 mortgage, the extra interest premium amounts to a charge of €250 a month or €3,000 a year.

Despite the use of a polite language about ‘mistakes’ and apologies when these scandals come to light, the reality is that banks are engaged in massive fraud.

They are making ordinary people pay for the speculative activities they engaged in during the Celtic Tiger.

The aim is to push for higher profits in order to pave the way to eventual privatisation.

Leo Varadkar’s government has actively conspired with banks to ‘squeeze the middle’ by refusing to intervene in this scandal.

The next time his PR machine makes reference to the ‘squeezed middle’, we should be clear who is doing the ‘squeezing’.","245","https://www.facebook.com/peoplebeforeprofitofficial/posts/pfbid0dE6iamKozu95cim24Fv8etVhpBX8NLYou3ofjpSryYGuARAR2wVwMZLHAdxowik7l"

The service has become ""a free-for-all"", she says, ""hollowing out"" the city centre and exacerbating the housing crisis as residents are pushed out to accommodate tourists. 

“Even though we have regulations in place since July it is true to say that tourism lets are effectively still unregulated in Galway city, and indeed right across the country,"" said Cllr O'Reilly.

“This is having a deeper impact here in Galway as we experience higher tourism numbers than other parts of the country - especially with Galway 2020 coming next year.""

She continues: ""This is the wrong way to do planning. We need to see people living where the services are.""

If elected, our TDs pledge to do the following:

➡️ Make housing a human right: Propose a bill for proper rent controls and security of tenure; fight to stop the sell-off of public land; propose a national construction company to build affordable houses; hold a referendum to enshrine a right to housing in the constitution.

➡️ End the two-tier health system: Fight for a national health service, free at the point of use, publicly owned and democratically run; hire more frontline staff; increase pay to cut hospital waiting lists.

➡️ Take radical action for the climate – for people and planet: Fight for free public transport and more buses; provide proper grants to fund deep-retrofitting of houses.; stop the importation of fracked gas; create a just transition for workers and farmers; put a carbon tax on the big polluters, not on ordinary people.

➡️ Provide a fair deal for the elderly: Restore the pension age to 65; increase the state pension to €260 a week; restore the transitional pension scheme.

➡️ Create a living wage and job security: Fight to scrap Croke Park hours for public servants; insist on increasing the minimum wage to a living wage of €15 an hour; abolish USC tax for those under €90,000 and introduce a high-income charge for those over it.

➡️ Guarantee 33 hours of free childcare per week: Cap fees at 3% of income and then move to a free service through a National Childcare Service.

➡️ Education for lifelong learning: Fight to scrap third level fees; raise the SUSI grants and eligibility thresholds; insist on smaller class sizes in schools.

➡️ Guarantee real equality for people with disabilities and special needs: Ensure public transport is accessible to all; hire more Special Needs Assistants; guarantee early assessment and intervention for autism and disabilities.

➡️ Abolish unjust taxes and end rip off insurance: Fight to scrap the property tax on family homes; propose a publicly owned insurance company to cut costs.

Fine Gael and Fianna Fail are partners and share the same conservative policies.

But now Fianna Fail present themselves a party of change, capable of leading a new government.

Their record tells a different story.

Fianna Fail started the attack on social housing and by the time they left office, 98,318 households were on the housing list.

Fianna Fail started the run down of the health service, promoting ‘co-located’ private hospitals on the site of public hospitals.

Fianna Fail supported the increase in the retirement age to 67 and eventually 68.

Fianna Fail loaded the Irish people with €64 billion in debt after they demanded that we ‘re-capitalise’ banks.

Fianna Fail did a deal with the Bishops to ‘indemnify’ them against the cost of claims on child abuse.

The party has a long record of corruption.

Its former leader, Charlie Huaghey took bribes worth €8 million.

Another, Bertie Ahern, could not explain a €30,000 donation that appeared weeks after a meeting with a property developer.

Their former press officer, Frank Dunlop, was jailed for corruption.

Three of its TDs, Liam Lawlor, Ray Burke, and Ivor Callely have been jailed various forms of corruption.

Micheal Martin goes back a long way, starting out as a Minister in 1997. He associated with many of these people but saw or heard nothing?

The Virgin Media debate between Varadkar and Martin was more like two branch managers of a bank comparing notes. It was dreary and boring.

The lack of real political choice was evident when Varadkar offered Martin a grand coalition if Fine Gael could not get a majority with Labour and the Greens.

The only reason why Martin did not accept was because he is still pretending to be the ‘ leader of the opposition’.

The debate showed just three things:

First they both acknowledged that FF, FG Labour and the Greens had all backed the move to increase the pension age to 68.

The FF-Green government originally proposed it. Then Joan Burton Labour Party leader introduced it in Social Welfare and Pension Act in 2011, which FG voted for.

The only way to restore the pension age to 65, is to vote for the left alternative to these parties.

Second, they both wanted to appear nice to the Greens. Martin was the most fulsome in his praise because his party is already forging an alliance with the Greens at local level. 

In Dublin City Council, for example, the FF-Labour-Green coalition voted to sell off public land at Devaney Gardens.

Third, both Varadkar and Martin attacked Sinn Fein and ruled out a border poll. Their attacks on Sinn Fein - who were not present – was a disgrace.

But Mary Lou McDonald should draw a clear conclusion from this – Sinn Fein should stop asking to join FF or FG in government. They should join up with the left and promote a call to ‘Break the Cycle’ of FF and FG.","356","https://www.facebook.com/peoplebeforeprofitofficial/posts/pfbid034cuVcinGZNP9BnF9mMkesonFQjqx88arMfn7u5boyR8C8zsXGSicMLm8yDHDQN5ul"

Our #NoConfidence motion in the #Dail this evening is putting clear focus on the issue Housing. We're calling for Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy to be replaced. His approach has not worked. We need a whole new approach to housing to ensure an adequate number of houses that are affordable for our people.","25","https://www.facebook.com/socialdemocratsireland/videos/652378668628024/"

However much the establishment might laugh, the housing crisis is not a game for struggling people. Since this speech, these predictions have become a reality. 

Fianna Fáil and the Green Party got the ball rolling. Fine Gael and Labour then continued the policies that have pushed thousands into homelessness. So many more people are couch surfing or struggling just to meet their rent or mortgage payments.

People Before Profit have fought them all the way on housing. Now the time as come for real change: We need to break the Fine Gael-Fianna Fáil cycle and force them out!

In 2016, televised debates included a range of parties. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael combined received less than 50% of the first preference vote for the first time in the history of the Irish state. The establishment now wishes to shore up support for Ireland's two right wing parties by excluding other groups from the official election narrative.

After the last election, the Solidarity-PBP alliance was fifth largest party in Ireland, (based on first-preference vote share and number of seats). For our part, we are being excluded from many polls and debates and getting far less coverage than parties who received a lower vote share than us.

Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil are happy for the debate to be limited to their essentially ideologically identical politics and appear not to want to debate with anyone who who is even just outside of their ideological realm.

It is shameful that Ireland's media denies a platform to politics outside of the neoliberal limits of the Fianna Fáil/Fine Gael debate. It also shows how rattled the Irish establishment is. They are eager to protect the status quo and return to the days of domination of two parties.

Let's make sure we get the word out there that there is an alternative to the traditional right wing rulers of Ireland. Speak to everyone you can and urge them not to give any of their preferences to the parties who have wrecked living standards in Ireland or to those who will prop them up.

A new report by Oxfam indicates that Ireland has the fifth highest number of billionaires per head of population in the world.

But under Ireland’s notorious tax exile rule, many do not pay tax.

A study of 450 ‘high net worth’ individuals by the Irish Revenue Commissioners in 2011 found that 54 have declared themselves resident abroad.

These include Denis O’ Brien who is officially declared as a tax resident of Malta. Dermot Desmond resides for tax purposes in Gibraltar. John Magnier has chosen Switzerland.

In response to growing outrage, the government imposed a ‘domicile levy’ to extract some money from the wealthy.

But this has fallen into disrepair as the both the money raised and the numbers of millionaires paying declined. In 2010, 32 individuals paid €3.43 million in tax but by 2015 just 13 individuals paid €2.30 million.

The Comptroller and Auditor General subsequently revealed that of 334 High Net Worth Individuals, 83 paid less tax in 2015 than the average PAYE worker on €36,500.

Ireland has become a tax dodging haven for very wealthy individuals and big corporations. But middle income workers end up paying high rates of tax.

People Before Profit want to cut the USC tax on workers earning below €90,000. To help pay for it, we will end the tax exile rule, impose a wealth tax and higher income tax bands on those earning over €90,000.

It is time we had some tax justice.","459","https://www.facebook.com/peoplebeforeprofitofficial/posts/pfbid02bayah23wxQUnDbkzhvvj87GSmb5SCFLfNryEoVr2GRXK9R5WSKX46PHSUPejCsY2l"

Whether you are a traditional manual worker or a white-collar worker, you need greater protection. Yet low pay is on the rise, particularly for the young. Many are in precarious, insecure employment. Instead of a government that looks after corporations, we need one that ensures workers have more rights. People Before Profit support strong unions that stand up for workers’ rights. Today, many union leaders have become too close to employers and the government. They need to become more democratic and fight for their members. Workers should also have a right to freedom of association – to join a union of their choice. We will support the following legislative changes:

➡️ Ban discrimination – pay parity and restoration now: Public sector workers hired after 2011 are paid less than those who joined before. Additionally, some public sector workers are paid less than similarly qualified workers. Nurses and teachers were right to strike for pay parity and restoration. We would repeal FEMPI terms and support public sector workers in their call for pay parity and restoration.

➡️ End the gender pay gap: It is completely unacceptable that women are paid less than men for doing the same work. This in-built sexism needs to be weeded out through legislation, union action and cultural changes.

➡️ Give all workers equal rights from day one: Whether you are part-time or full-time, temporary or permanent, you should have the same legal rights so that work conditions are not driven down.

➡️ Guarantee unions the right to access all workplaces: Unions should have the right to enter a workplace at least once a year to put the case for why people should join. They should also be able to inspect for adherence to labour legislation.

➡️ Recognise unions for bargaining: When at least 20 percent of the workers join a union, they should have a right to collectively bargain with their employer through their chosen union.

➡️ Ban zero-hour contracts: Workers have a right to a guaranteed number of hours per week.

➡️ Legislate for four extra holidays a year: With an annual right to 29 days holidays, workers in Ireland have one of the lowest entitlements in Europe. Give workers a statutory right to bereavement leave.

➡️ Raise the minimum wage to the living wage: A living wage is calculated on what one needs for a socially acceptable standard of living. It amounts to €12.30 an hour.

➡️ Pay for internships: They are often used to exploit and dash the hopes of the young. They are also a free subsidy to businesses who get cheap labour.

➡️ Bring labour agencies back into the public sector: End the practice of giving a bounty to private companies who force social welfare recipients to take up unsuitable jobs.

➡️ Reform the Insolvency Act and Companies Act: Workers should not be at the back of the queue. They should get the payments they are entitled to in redundancy situations.

➡️ Introduce maximum 5:1 pay ratios in the public sector so that top managers do not earn more than five times those on junior grades. Only award state contracts to private firms who adhere to this.

➡️ Change Industrial Relations Legislation: Abolish the 1990 Industrial Relations Act, which restrains workers from standing up for themselves. Stop companies taking out injunctions against workers and give workers a right to express solidarity.

➡️ Return the retirement age to 65: Protect workers’ pension rights.","75","https://www.facebook.com/peoplebeforeprofitofficial/posts/pfbid02U1d8ET7XHaMDXyA9bPwyLs2BkWpHLTmekLcoSZCVdkP9BSnSM9RmVFD3AAm5d9Vml"

Press statement:

Potential disenfranchisement of many thousands of electors a scandal that must be averted

Draft registers must be incorporated by all local authorities and supplementary register facility must be provided

Responding to the scenario that many thousands of potential electors may be disenfranchised in the forthcoming election by the non inclusion of those who registered in recent months as well as the non availability of the supplementary register facility Solidarity TD for Cork North Central Mick Barry TD said:

""It has been a positive feature of recent votes such as on marriage equality and repeal that tens if not hundreds of thousands of predominately young people registered in time to exercise their franchise and furthermore that special measures to facilitate a late surge of registrations were put in place.

""The contrast in terms of this election is stark. The non-availability of the supplementary register facility is bad enough. The news that those who registered late last year mindful of the likelihood of an election early this year and are currently on the draft register may be excluded is scandalous.

Dublin West Solidarity TD Ruth Coppinger added:

""I welcome the promise of Dublin City Council and Fingal that they would do what it takes to include all those on the draft register but it only throws into sharp relief the perversity of some or most local authorities across the state not similarly acting.

""Many of those who registered late or who would ordinarily use the supplementary register facility are the youngest cohort of potential voters but also renters. The mass exclusion of this category will serve to politically skew the results which I suspect will not overly disturb the government. It is not acceptable and a commitment from the Minister responsible for local government Eoghan Murphy must commit today to provide the local authorities whatever they need to ensure maximum participation.""

""I dread to think of how different our experience might have been if politicians at that time were openly encouraging fear and distrust of migrants.

""Verona Murphy's comments betray deeply held prejudices against some of our most marginalised and discriminated-against communities. She has proven herself unfit to be a public representative.”

Joe O'Brien - who has worked in the area of migrant rights for twenty years - says: ""Fine Gael must stop defending her, stop funding her, and publicly cut ties with her.

• Hold a referendum to insert a ‘right to housing’ clause into the Irish constitution: Human rights do not just include political freedoms – the state should have a legal obligation to provide housing.
• Immediately declare a housing emergency: This will enable the state to borrow funds to begin a major house-building programme and to withdraw from paying out €500 million a year to private landlords.
• Create a national construction company: There is no reason why the state cannot build houses. State-owned land is available and tens of thousands of construction workers either here or abroad who would be willing to work for decent wages.
• Build 100,000 council houses over five years: This will cost €3 billion in the first year and a total of €14 billion over five years, but it will become self-financing by year six and into the future. This programme will also provide jobs in the construction sector and add to revenue receipts.
• Control the price of building land to create affordable housing: You can build a three-bedroomed house for less than €200,000. If speculation in land were stopped, we could have cheaper housing.
• Force NAMA to hand over land for public housing: This is public land – it should be used to build council houses cheaply.
• Stop the sell-off of public land to private developers: Fine Gael wants to sell off as much public land as cheaply as possible to their developer friends. This must be stopped. Public land should be used for council and affordable housing and community amenities.
• Implement rent controls and provide security of tenure: Rents are too high. The poor are being forced out of their communities. We would freeze the rents immediately and create a system whereby tenants can seek a cut in rents. 
• Create an independent review board for council tenants: At present, tenants cannot appeal decisions of their landlord – the local authorities. 
• Establish an Independent National Housing Agency to oversee the delivery of safe and culturally appropriate Traveller Accommodation.
• Ban economic evictions: Vulture funds are trying to increase the rate of evictions because property prices have risen. Landlords use loopholes such as renovations to evict tenants. If passed in the Dáil, the Solidarity-People Before Profit Anti-Eviction Bill would have closed these loopholes and banned evictions in cases of demonstrable economic distress. We will continue to fight to stem the tide of evictions.
• Impose a vacant dwelling levy: There are over 200,000 vacant properties in Ireland – even though thousands have no home. We need a ‘use it or lose it’ policy whereby private property owners will pay a special levy if their property is left empty for more than six months. We would impose a vacant land levy of 25 percent to be charged on land that is being held back for speculative reasons.
• Use Compulsory Purchase Orders: In some cases a levy will not be enough. If the public good demands it, the state should be able to use a CPO to attain appropriate accommodation.
• Reverse the scandal of self-certification of building works: Conduct immediate audits for fire and safety. Create a redress fund for the 90,000 houses built during the Celtic Tiger era that have serious defects. Levy the construction industry for this fund.

In Ireland, the wealth of the richest grew by 10% in just the last year alone, while at the same time people are in precarious work and rents are skyrocketing. It's not a coincidence!","22","https://www.facebook.com/risesocialists/posts/147979689933544"

That's the question being asked tonight, as 'Climate Week' kicks off on RTÉ, beginning a week of programming that looks at the impact of climate change on Ireland and around the world. 

Tune into 'Will Ireland Survive 2050' on RTÉ One at 9.35 and watch UCD climate scientist Cara Augustenborg and Met Éireann's Ger Flemming look at the consequences of ever more extreme weather events on the stability of our planet and our society, and how that may affect us 30 years from now.

The Irish Independent was on the campaign trail with our Dublin Fingal candidate, Cllr. Joe O'Brien, ahead of the by-elections on November 29th. Voters in Dublin Fingal have the chance to elect a strong, Green voice to represent them in the Dáil, pushing for more public transport and better, more sustainable development.

""There is housing going up, but it's the same old problem in that the infrastructure isn't going in,"" says Joe.

“Today is a devastating day for these workers and their families,"" says Senator Hackett. ""We welcome the fact that they hope to avoid compulsory redundancies and that a Just Transition Commissioner has been appointed, but providing a Just Transition means more than just moving people or giving a pay-out. It needs to be about supporting the community and giving people a future there. That’s why we need a permanent Just Transition Commission looking for and working with communities that are facing a change and building alternatives where they are.""

Cllr. O'Brien - who is on the monitoring committee of the National Migrant Integration Strategy and represents one of the most diverse constituencies in Ireland - said today: “With these comments, and previous flippant remarks on direct provision, the Taoiseach risks taking the national debate on immigration down a very dangerous path, and at a time when the far-right is getting more organised in Ireland, the leader of our country can’t be seen to be participating in their dangerous, divisive and inaccurate rhetoric.""

Tim Cooke, the chief Executive officer of the giant firm Apple, will fly into Ireland at the end of the month to get a special award from Leo Varadkar.

He will be presented with the ’inaugural IDA Ireland Special Recognition Award’ at a  special ceremony.

Apple owes the Irish people €13 billion in back taxes and this is now locked away in an ‘escrow’ account.

The Irish state has paid out huge sums to legal firms to mount a case to ensure that they did not receive a penny from Apple. 

Between 2014 and 2018, €5.8 million of taxpayers’ money was doled out to Irish legal and consultancy firms. 

This is only the start of a drip feed of lucrative state contracts as the Finance Minister, Pascal Donohoe, promised that 'the case will continue to be resourced as appropriate.’

Nothing better sums up the politics of Fianna Fail and Fine Gael. 

They will spend millions in legal fees to ensure that money due to the Irish people is not paid.

If Apples paid out the €13 billion it owes, plus the extra few billion in interest payments, the housing crisis could be solved quickly.

That will only happen if we break the cycle of FF and FG rule.","556","https://www.facebook.com/peoplebeforeprofitofficial/posts/2674181326006711"

Unfortunately, that's far from the worst that they're at over in the Dáil - the government has managed to de facto kill over 50 bills in the Dáil with its infamous ""money message"". Whenever the government loses a notable vote they insist that the legislation that gets passed requires some money to be spent, therefore requiring a ""money message"" from the executive approving it - which Fine Gael then refuses to give!

The way Fine Gael have been using the money message for years has been to exercise an anti-democratic veto over votes that they lose in the Dáil - and their pals in Fianna Fáil are happy to back them up on it!

One of the main reasons is that Dublin City is the third most congested city on the entire planet. With inadequate public transport infrastructure, people are driven into cars and that itself drives down the effectiveness of existing public transport!

If we want proper functioning public transport, it needs to be frequent, free, green and publicly owned so that it can be efficiently planned. It needs major investment that brings people out of cars, driving down costs, congestion and carbon emissions.

Fine Gael, along with Fianna Fáil and Labour, have for the past 8 years overseen an explosion in homelessness as the housing crisis has gotten worse and worse. The key reason for this is that the government simply refuses to build enough homes and simply refuses to control rents. The biggest cause of homelessness in this country is economic evictions.

We don't need crocodile tears and empty promises - we need a state construction company to engage in a programme of mass public housing builds, a ban on economic evictions, and rent controls now!

As part of our Green New Deal with socialist policies, we fight for investment in green jobs which would include a huge expansion in care work and our public services.

As Ireland continues to be the laggard of Europe when it comes to climate action, read how Green Party Leader Eamon Ryan, MEP for Dublin Ciarán Cuffe, and Agriculture Spokesperson Pippa Hackett have responded to the news that we are way off our emissions targets for the third year running.

❎ Missing these emissions targets for the third year in a row means the State will now be forced to pay hundreds of millions of euros in fines.

❎ Household emissions increased by 7.9% last year. 

As winters get colder, we need a national-scale retrofitting scheme that would help householders to reduce their energy costs AND their emissions.

❎ Transport emissions increased by 1.7% last year. 

We need to urgently flip our transport budget 2-to-1 in favour of spending on public transport and walking and cycling infrastructure.

❎ Agriculture emissions increased by 1.9% last year.

We need to overhaul our agriculture system to support the switch to low-carbon, nature-friendly farming practices that put family farms and the environment at the heart of agricultural policy.","97","https://www.facebook.com/GreenPartyIreland/posts/pfbid029CwdbeDRVndfLXD35nKgszvZheCUDBTTZLGGmTUkyPMVzvMD4Uxk8CKK3rGSF7ial"

Housing is one of the big issues in this election and, suddenly, all parties are showing ‘concern’.

But here are the facts:

Homelessness has grown from 3,500 people  in 2011 to 10,250 today.

Dublin has the third highest rents in Europe. The rest the country is not far behind.

Most young people can no longer buy a house. Many stay with their parents into their 30s.

The reason for the crisis is that Fine Gael and Fine Fail rely on the private market for solutions.

One in three of their TDs are landlords and they oppose any genuine rent controls.

Both parties ganged up to stop a Solidarity-People Before Profit bill to put a  right to housing bill into the constitution.

But there are real solutions and they come from the left.

People Before Profit want to stop the sale of public land to private developers. This land could be used to be build thousands of social and affordable houses cheaply.

The price of building land around cities should be controlled. Today, speculators apply to re-zone land and then sit back while land values increase.

There could be proper rent controls that allow people to apply for rent cuts. If a tenant can show that rents consume more than one third of their income – which international research indicates is below poverty line -  they should be able to apply for a cut.

These solutions entail a break with a policy of ‘not interfering in the market’ and that is why conservative parties like Fianna Fail and Fine Gael oppose them.

But if you want left policies, you need to vote for the genuine left.

In heat of the election battle, others will say they are opposed to selling off public land.

But councillors from Labour, Greens, Social Democrats and even Sinn Fein have voted to sell off public land.

The one party that stands strong for genuine left policies is Solidarity-People Before Profit.","178","https://www.facebook.com/peoplebeforeprofitofficial/posts/pfbid02UyRtr1nMgXtJCTC1am6dTi1NAfroQbQzuSGp9zgvNFyRN9c8vQcuQ6MzPXML8MM7l"

Deputy Cowen was a key part of the Fianna Fáil budget negotiation team in the talks.

A total of €31m in funding will be focused on the midlands region. The new fund will be focused on social housing retrofits, peatland rehabilitation and the local economy. It will have an independent Just Transition Commissioner to oversee the fund. The main aim will be to plan, invest and implement a transition to alternative and sustainable jobs in different sectors that will protect and enhance the economy of the region.

Commenting on the news Deputy Cowen stated “We fought long and hard to ensure that the transition to a green economy in the midlands is given the support it needs. I am happy to confirm that after direct talks with the Minister for Finance over the past number of weeks Fianna Fáil has secured a new fund for Offaly and the surrounding counties.

“€20m will be dedicated to the creation of a new energy efficiency scheme targeted, initially, at the social housing stock in the region. This will create new, sustainable employment in the region. €5m for peatland rehabilitation and €6m to a flexible fund to be focused on those local priorities.

“It is estimated that this new investment will support over 400 environmentally sustainable jobs, with up to 100 more jobs through expanded peatlands rehabilitation.

“The midlands has a proud tradition of work with Bord Na Mona that stretches back for decades and across countless households. We now need to prepare for the transition to a green economy that promotes employment and invests in communities. This is a key test for our state to show that we can change to a green pathway while protecting jobs and communities affected by that transition,” Deputy Cowen concluded.","45","https://www.facebook.com/fiannafail/videos/511962109599001/"

This is the fourth successive increase secured by Fianna Fáil under the Confidence and Supply arrangement.

Deputy Donnelly said, “There are approximately one million people on waiting lists – that’s just under a quarter of our entire population. Fine Gael have presided over the highest waiting lists ever seen in this country.

“In 2016, following a 38% increase in inpatient/day case waiting lists under the tenure of then Health Minister Leo Varadkar, Fianna Fáil secured the reactivation of the National Treatment Purchase Fund in the Confidence and Supply Arrangement.

“In each successive year we have secured an increase in funding for it and we know that it is working – the inpatient day case list has fallen from a high of over 86,000 in 2017 to just under 69,000 in August.

“I also want to welcome the reduction in prescription charges and the €10 reduction in the threshold for the drug payment scheme. These measures are a key part of Sláintecare and Fianna Fáil has been looking for progress on them. By seeking action and progress in these areas, we have been condemned by Fine Gael TDs as “reckless”. I look forward to them now voicing the same vitriol concern with Minister Donohoe for taking action on them today”, he concluded.","80","https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=10162296458175133&set=a.10150643735250133"

People and the planet should not be sacrificed in the interest of profit. There were powerful speeches from trade union activists and workers chants for hours outside the Dáil. There is a video being shared of protesters singing  “Gardai, we love you”. This has understandably caused irritation from activists who have experienced the violence of the Gardai in the past, for example in Take Back The City or Shell2Sea. 

However, this was not the main message or event of the day. It is inevitable that many new activists will not have had either the personal experience of Garda violence or been involved in discussions about the real nature of the capitalist state. Within XR, there will need to be discussion and debate about tactics, and openness to learn from past struggles such as at Rossport.  We encourage people to get involved in XR, share their experiences of past struggles and learn from those newly involved.","26","https://www.facebook.com/risesocialists/posts/pfbid02PCoyNGuzzr7HL13cBFkZ9iPQXEqxg5tQmsFH34pCXKoML3wvs89c5Lo48hgS3pr9l"

Thousands of people who want to vote could be disenfranchised if the General Election is called before February 15th.

The new electoral register only comes into force after February 15th.

So if any young person applied to be registered late last year, they could be denied a vote.

Or if someone who was angered by the health service decided to recently register, they would be denied a vote.

The only way a potential voter could overcome this would be to apply to be included in a 
supplementary register.

However this requires going to a Garda station and getting a form stamped. They would only have a short period of time to do this.

Fine Gael have been talking about updating the electoral register for some time.

Their main proposal was to insist that voters be required to bring a PPS number to the polling booths.

Many civil society groups, however, proposed that online registration should be introduced so that it would be easier to vote.

If Varadkar wanted to facilitate new voters, he could put the election back a few days or else bring in emergency legislation to allow them to vote.

Let’s see what he does.","200","https://www.facebook.com/peoplebeforeprofitofficial/posts/pfbid02iG1uv3C8FuecQg8xZY3UHJ5H6uT7t5XES2PpWW5raLR9s97HoPXiREoW5TENb3htl"

Fianna Fail and Fine Gael have ruled this country for nearly eighty years and they are trying to narrow this election to a choice between them. But their policies are almost exactly the same.

Today, Fine Gael presides over a health system that has the longest waiting lists in Europe – but when they were n office Fianna Fail cut 2,000 beds from the health service.

Both oppose proper rent controls and regulation of the price of building land because they are devotees of the ‘free market’.

The days of two and a half party system are over. Today both FF and FG command just over half the votes of the electorate whereas in the past they 
had over 80 percent.

People Before Profit is standing in this election to offer a real alternative.

Our aim is to make a start on breaking the cycle of FF and FG rule. We give one cast iron guarantee – a vote for People Before Profit will never be used to put one of the conservative parties into power.

We are advocating policies that promote greater equality, radical climate action and high quality public services. We want to shift the tax burden from PAYE worker and place it more firmly on the shoulders of the wealthy and the big corporations by closing off their tax loopholes.

Google, for example has just declared €15 billion in tax – and has not paid us a penny. Apple owe us €13 billion in back taxes – but the two conservative parties are spending millions of OUR money to ensure we don’t get it.

People Before Profit would put an immediately embargo on the sell-off of public land – and use it for social and affordable houses.

Sweden has rejected an application for an LNG terminal that would import fracked gas from the US - similar to the one proposed for the Shannon estuary - and our MEP for Ireland South Grace O'Sullivan has called on the Irish Government to follow their lead, stop the development of the Shannon LNG terminal, and invest in clean, home-grown energy instead energy. 

""We need to take the money we are about to sink into the Shannon LNG terminal and redirect it to clean homegrown energy. That would be a far better investment for the planet and for our own energy security.”

Please give this amazing video made by Collective Dublin ten minutes of your time today. Then consider joining Extinction Rebellion Ireland to show your support for #RebellionWeek. Beginning Monday, October 7th at 12pm with a rally at the Dail, the Extinction Rebellion Ireland rebels will take and hold a key site in Dublin City Centre, with music, rallies, panel discussions, a family day and more planned throughout the week.
⏳⏳⏳
While we share a common goal, Rebellion Week is not a Green Party event and - both internationally or here in Ireland - the Extinction Rebellion movement is not associated with any political party. These rebels are ordinary people, rising for change, and to change everything they need everyone. Support them next week if you can. Time is running out.

Internet privacy needs to be defended from governments looking to snoop on users’ messages under the guise of security. The NSA scandal exposed by Snowden a number of years ago shows the type of surveillance they want to carry out. 

But neither can we rely on major corporations like Facebook, Google or individuals like Marc Zuckerberg not to abuse their positions. 

The major tech and social media companies and the huge power they have shouldn’t be run for profit or as a way to spy on the public. Instead they should be democratically controlled by the workers in the industry and the users of the service as a public utility.","19","https://www.facebook.com/risesocialists/posts/pfbid03DYcvwfPwrLzzQtdN2DQHgxsbnqHJPaxW8vFwTWi6oKp1VSSkB7NgmWsYL4sRPWkl"

The report shows that over a 10 year period (2009-18) that motor insurance claims went down 2.5% while insurance premiums rose 42%. The average claim per policy was down from €437 to €426 while the average premium rose from €498 to €706.
Meanwhile, average profits rose 9% last year which was nearly double the profits recorded by the industry in the UK.
The reports’ findings fly completely in the face of the industry narrative of increased claims, spiralling costs and pressure on profits.
Deputy Barry said this morning: “The industry has clearly engaged in a sustained campaign of misinformation - claims are down, costs are down and profits are way, way up. While the industry has been putting on poor mouth they have actually been involved in profiteering on a massive scale.  Insurance in this country needs to be completely reorganized and run on a not for profit basis.  The State should establish its own insurance company, take the companies which have ripped off the Irish people into public ownership, and offer insurance for people’s needs not shareholder profit.”","26","https://www.facebook.com/solidarityie/posts/1601407966667680"

It establishes an accumulation of misery, corresponding with accumulation of capital.

A new report has come out showing that Ireland has the 5th highest number of ultra-wealthy people per capita on the planet. At the same time we have skyrocketing rents, precarious and low paid work, and widespread deprivation in our society. It’s not a coincidence.

Thousands school secretaries will take strike action today. They are protesting over a measly pay offer and to demand job security.

Most school secretaries are employed directly by their school’s board of management and paid from the school’s ancillary grant.

This system shows exactly how school secretaries are undervalued. An ‘ancillary grant’ means that they are paid of the ‘extra bit’ that is left over after other running costs of a school are covered.

In practice, school secretaries are paid a salary of €12,000 a year. One of the main reasons for this is that they receive no pay during holiday periods.

Yet the reality is that there is much administrative work still to be done during holiday times and there is no reason why the jobs should not be a proper year-long post.

Two factors, however, lie behind this strange position.

First, Ireland operates a system whereby religious groups run most of the schools and these receive grants from the state to fun their operations.

Second, the position of schools secretaries is normally held by women. As part of a wider culture of sexism, their pay was seen as just a ‘supplement’ rather than being a proper full time job.

Just as Irish women have stood up in other areas against a disgraceful treatment, school secretaries have moved into action to gain proper respect and pay.

People Before Profit fully supports the school secretaries. It is a disgrace that the Workplace Relations Commission awarded them a ting 1.5% increase.

They deserve far more.

They should be put on the payroll of the Department of Education and given proper job security. It is our hope that the teachers unions will come out fully in support of their colleagues.","39","https://www.facebook.com/peoplebeforeprofitofficial/posts/pfbid022kMM9FqMMHyuVKMGR4Y3FoxdtZ9z8VTtb8vnoptX9ELoMTwrh2mD9eg6BcGajc3jl"

The four letters of RISE give a picture of the politics we stand for: Radical, Internationalist, Socialist and Environmentalist.

All around the world, radical young people and workers are on the move. Ten days ago we saw millions of school students in over 150 countries, joined by workers and other young people, participate in the Global Climate Strike, the largest environmental protest in history. This past Friday, millions more young people and workers marched again. This environmental movement joins the global feminist wave as a social movement mobilising millions. Socialist ideas are becoming popularised, seen for example in the 55,000 overwhelmingly new members of the Democratic Socialists of America. If the coming global recession brings the usual calls for cutbacks and wage cuts, it will be met by the resistance of workers internationally.

The question for socialists in Ireland and around the world is how to participate to help build these movements while also advocating for the necessary eco-socialist change. We have been involved as activists in the movements to defeat the water charges, for abortion rights and for the right to housing, to halt climate change and environmental destruction, and many other issues. The conclusion we have drawn is that socialists need to participate in these movements in an open, non-sectarian way, willing to work alongside others who don’t share all of our views, while putting forward our own ideas. In our view this is an important part of socialists contributing to the rebuilding of the broader workers’ movement, including active trade union and housing movements and a new broad mass party of the left.

Our members have joined and are helping to build Extinction Rebellion. We will work alongside hundreds of other activists for the most effective ‘Rebellion Week’ of civil disobedience in October as part of building the mass movement necessary to stop climate change.

One of our key priorities as a group will be to prepare and launch a Green New Deal with socialist policies for Ireland. At this moment of ecological, social and economic crises, a transformative plan is needed - for free, green and frequent public transport, for a rapid and just transition to green energy, including a green jobs programme in renewable energy and care work, for a sustainable model of agriculture that supports our small farmers, for quality low carbon de-commodified public housing, a 4 day week, and a planned economy under the democratic control of working class people. 

We recognise that division amongst the left can be demoralising for working class people who rightly want to see maximum unity against the right wing parties and their policies. Although no longer a part of the Socialist Party, we are committed to co-operating with the Socialist Party and others on the left on a day-to-day basis and will remain part of the Solidarity - People Before Profit grouping.

We will be building RISE as a radical socialist organisation and producing a regular political magazine and website with analysis and commentary (www.letusrise.ie). We also want to contribute to the building of a broader mass party of the left, with a vibrant democratic culture of debate and discussion. This is desperately needed to challenge and end neo-liberal and capitalist domination, which, with its drive to privatise and cut back, has prioritised the needs of big business and the market over our lives and our future.","54","https://www.facebook.com/risesocialists/posts/pfbid02TuBS5jDvMPYfStuRJdRJQMaCchdYSVyUPfEp8KNYS5HpcBmKMyKBPbnSC6nWLqodl"

The hospital trolley crisis has hit record levels with 760 patients affected.

But an e mail sent by Dr Brendan McCann, the head of the emergency department at University Hospital Waterford, to the HSE has warned of horrific consequences.

Dr McCann pointed out that research in Britain showed that 1 in 83 patents die as a result of waiting over 6 hours in emergency departments.

He wrote that ‘At UHW, this is about two a week or more than 100 a year. I would also point out that our waits are longer than six hours so the figure is likely to be higher.”

Yet this is only one hospital and if we move on to the national figures, we are talking about an estimated 8 people a day possibly dying as a result of the hospital crisis.

The figure could be higher because patients are waiting for longer than 6 hours in many hospitals.

Health Minister, Simon Harris, should stop his PR games and declare a national health emergency.

An immediate campaign must be started to raise the salaries of nurses and doctors so that hospital wards can be staff. Private hospitals should be brought into public ownership and integrated into the health service. Serious measures must be taken to save lives.","84","https://www.facebook.com/peoplebeforeprofitofficial/posts/pfbid0N1a8hmfx19GqsQfAu8fsbsBhEejQb7wbsEBuyV4Hpqhnhp9LnApJC4CLPTqtJtJSl"

But there's a sharper edge to this anger too. It is not just that Fine Gael want to honour the imperial masters of old. They embody the viciousness of the old British ruling class.

The RIC were the bailiffs who evicted people before the Irish Revolution drove them out. Fine Gael are the modern day party of evictions presiding over the worst housing crisis in the history of the state.

British imperialism devastated the lives of people in Ireland and all over the world for the sake of profit. In modern day Ireland, it is Fine Gael who usher in the vulture funds and major corporations to line their pockets and immiserate the people who live here.

💚🌳
We'll be asking Dáil Éireann to embrace a new vision for forestry in Ireland. Diverse, native woodlands have the power to store carbon, improve water quality, and support and protect biodiversity.
💚🌳
Planting millions of native trees can create valuable public amenities, pave the way for a new generation of foresters and farmers, and reinvigorate rural communities. 
💚🌳
Trees are our future. We have to start investing in that future now.

""New 'noise zone' maps recently published by Fingal County Council show that noise from the flight pathway of the new runway will have a very significant impact for residents of south Swords, most of Malahide and now all of Portmarnock,"" says Cllr. O'Brien. ""All these areas are in a zone where noise levels are expected to have a negative impact on health, especially for more vulnerable people such a the very young and our older community members.""

""Fingal County Council would require noise insulation in a planning application for a new home in these areas once the second runway is opened. However crucially for residents already living in this zone, there is no noise insulation scheme to offset the negative impacts the new runway will have on their quality of life and their health.""

""The importance of public health in Fingal is being relegated and ignored in the process of trying to make the airport bigger.""","23","https://www.facebook.com/GreenPartyIreland/posts/10159084405968066"

But behind it lies Fine Gael’s ambition to draw this country ever closer into a web of imperialist relations.

The RIC was one of the first police forces ever formed in the world. Their purpose was to keep Ireland safe for the British empire. They were recruited from rural areas and were chosen because they were amongst the biggest and largest men. In 1913, the Dublin Metropolitan Police – the RIC’s counterpart in the city – baton-charged striking workers so ferociously that they murdered two people.

After 1919 a popular struggle – involving thousands of people who took up arms – drove out the RIC and formed liberated zones in parts of the country. Police stations were burnt to the ground and a mass boycott meant that people refused to supply them. The IRA embarked on a campaign of shootings to force them out, killing many RIC officers. By 1920, the RIC had retreated from 500 barracks.

In response to this, Winston Churchill sent in the ‘Black and Tans’ to bolster the RIC. These became part of the official RIC and their name comes from the fact that they combined the Khaki of the British army with the Black of the RIC uniform. Their main tactic was to launch reprisal and murder squads against the population. The activities of the RIC and the Black and Tans are well known in Ireland. They burnt towns like Balbriggan and Cork and murdered innocent people.

Instead of commemorating this brutal, repressive force, we should be celebrating an Irish revolution that drove them out.

But that is not in Fine Gael’s nature. The party has always wanted to bring Ireland back into the Commonwealth and turn us into a minor player in the Anglo-American imperial enterprise.

We should totally reject Flanagan’s stupid idea. But while doing so, let’s link our anger to the contemporary world and demand that the US army also get out of Shannon. If it was right to throw out the Black and Tans, then it is equally right to throw the US and British armies out of Iraq.","588","https://www.facebook.com/peoplebeforeprofitofficial/posts/pfbid02NYhLmYWezkmoQg4S8BYsGQ1BNaktU9nFXz2aJSeCvE7Ftca4j93BQjXAXHrUN21zl"

The mainstream media have ignored the real news about 2019 – it was a year of global revolt.

Massive numbers have marched on the streets of not only Lebanon, Iraq, and Chile but also Hong Kong, Ecuador, Honduras, Haiti, Egypt, and Algeria.

Dictators have been toppled and frightened world leaders are suddenly talking about reform.

The revolts are a cry against inequality and a demand for a decent life.

In 2015 Oxfam reported that 62 individuals possessed the same wealth as 3.6 billion, half of the world’s population. Yet the wealthy continually demand more.

In Chile, it was an increase in public transport fares; in Lebanon, it was a tax on WhatsApp; in other countries it was the withdrawal of food subsidies.

In Ireland, the elite watch these events nervously and try to manage discontent by avoiding flashpoints.

They have postponed property tax increases; they have deferred an ‘excessive water charge’; they have started with small carbon taxes and will escalate them gradually over the next ten years.

But look at what is happening in France. For almost a month, workers have been on strike against attempts to raise the pension age.

And the reason for the strike? The Macron government want to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64!

In Ireland, we must already work until 66 and next year it will increase again to 67. It will then go to 68 in 2027, making it the oldest in Europe.

Each year’s increase is the equivalent of €13,000, which is a bigger robbery than the water charges and property taxes combined.

If that is not reason enough to revolt, consider the following facts:

Ireland has the second highest costs for childcare in the EU.

Our primary school classes are amongst the largest in Europe.

Aside from Britain, we have the highest level of university fees in Europe.

Dublin Bus commuters pay double the EU average.

It is dearer to rent in Dublin than Paris – it is the 3rd most expensive of 59 cities in Europe.

Hospital waiting lists are among the worst in Europe.

And all of this because we live under a right wing regime that has created a tax haven paradise for global corporations.

In 2020, we need to get out on the streets in huge numbers – just like we did on the water charges.

On January 11th, there will be the first of a series of demonstrations over the housing crisis.  We urge you to get there at 1pm on O'Connell Bridge, Dublin.

But as well as demonstrating, we need to break the grip that the two right wing parties have over Irish politics.

Ever since the foundation of this state, nearly 100 years, one of them has being running our country.

At various times, they have been propped up by left sounding parties in coalition  – such as Labour or the Greens – but they have always run the show.

Now even Sinn Féin state that they are willing to join a coalition led by either Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael. But if we want to change this country, we need to start really opposing them.

That is why Solidarity-People Before Profit will be the only party standing in next year’s general election whose votes can never be used to support a Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil Taoiseach.

In the next few weeks, we shall be looking for your active support on this task.

We shall be holding a special canvas training for election workers on January 25th.

We shall be making a financial appeal to raise funds.

We are embarking on a major recruitment drive.

Press Statement: Solidarity Councillors Sandra Fay and Kieran Mahon

€70,000 for junkets instead of assistance to homeless families
Solidarity proposal to tax major corporations in the County shut down
 

The budget in South Dublin County Council was the first under the Green Party, Fianna Fail and Fine Gael coalition. Their first action in local government together was to go after pensioners by removing the OAP rent allowance of €10 per week, attacking people who have seen no increase in their payments from the national budget.

In addition, the coalition group have implemented a €3 euro per week increase on all local authority rents, with no regard for income level or ability to pay, meaning that over 65-year olds will see an annual increase in rents of €676. The move came just 72 hours after Green Party Councillors voted for a motion that was passed against any increase in local authority rents.

They attempted to justify their actions by the shortfall in council income due to the removal of Irish Water from Council control- another key part of Green, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael policy, and one on which their attempts to bring in water charges were roundly defeated. The ruling coalition refused to even argue for increased government subvention in council funding to close any shortfall.

Cllr Kieran Mahon said, “This represents an absolutely shameful attack on local authority tenants- particularly over 65s. The level of betrayal by the Green Party is almost unbelievable as just 72 hours earlier their Councillors had voted against any increase in local authority rents.”

Cllr Sandra Fay said “Solidarity put forward alternative proposals that could have raised over €10 million per year by putting additional rates on the top multi nationals in the county, with no impact on small companies. This would have raised multiples of rent increases and given the council extra resources to invest in maintenance, housing and community facilities.”

“South Dublin is currently home to 2 of the world’s top 3 IT companies, 4 of the world's top R&D investors and 2 of the top 20 pharmaceutical companies in the world and is now a major base for Amazon- owned by the world’s richest man. Yet we have 10,000 people on housing lists, a collapse in the provision of quality public housing and maintenance and require a revolution in how we tackle climate change in the coming years. These issues cannot be resolved by attacking local authority tenants and senior citizens. They require a determined and detailed approach to using the wealth in society for the benefit of all.”

Parents in many parts of the country are facing a crisis this Xmas because they cannot find a place for their children in a creche.

The immediate cause is an attempt by the insurance industry to hike up charges. In some cases, they want to treble the cost of their premiums.

This is the latest twist in a scandal that is affecting Irish society at many different levels.

In the past the insurance industry ripped off drivers and pushed up premiums to dramatically increase their profits. Now they are trying the same trick with the country’s creches.

Fine Gael have repeated the lies of the insurance industry and have consistently justified their price hikes. They have, for example, blamed drivers for making fraudulent claims.

Yet recent Central Bank report has revealed that the average motor insurance premium was up 42pc between 2009 and 2018, while the cost of claims fell by 2.5pc during in the same period. Meanwhile, insurers made an average profit of 9pc last year.

People Before Profit have consistently exposed the  greed of the insurance industry. We proposed the formation of a state run insurance company, modelled on the one formed in Manitoba in Canada.

A not-for profit enterprise could provide far cheaper insurance, especially if linked to a less costly form of mediation to settle claims.

However Ireland’s system of childcare has deeper problems as well. It is the most expensive in Europe because it relies almost exclusively on private enterprise. Up to recently, there has been poor regulation and, in many instances creches, are under—resourced.

People  Before Profit have proposed a National Childcare Service that would hire an extra 25,000 childcare professionals.

Current services that are deemed best practice will be integrated into the new National Service. The capitation grant should also be increased to make sure that parents only pay a maximum of 30% of the total cost of their children’s care.

Beyond that the state needs to move one based on a public system.","118","https://www.facebook.com/peoplebeforeprofitofficial/posts/pfbid0ya7bnbEf2s8DUkQamiCv7ZDXHtt8vagE1RbV9yg1Xf45dWHu6YT84Jq6E1jjUALWl"

'The Westminster election results were a warning to the big parties. People want change, and they want it now. A return to the Stormont gravy train of the past simply will not do. 

'We need urgent action to address the devastation of welfare reform. Increasing numbers of people are going to food banks. The mitigations are nowhere near enough to protect the vulnerable. 

'The Stormont talks must urgently address the need for a reversal in welfare cuts, and a benefit system fit for purpose. 

'While politicians are talking behind closed doors on the hill, nurses and health workers are taking action on the streets. Any executive which doesn’t address the concerns of these workers isn’t worth its salt. 

‘Nor can any incoming Executive ignore the growing threat of climate change. Previous Stormont administrations were notable in their inaction on the environment. We need to ban extraction of fossil fuels, put an end to fracking, and begin the development of a serious program for the development of Green energy.

'These talks should be conducted in an inclusive and transparent manner. Dodgy SF/DUP stitch ups should be a thing of the past. We need all party talks now. Socialist parties with a mandate like PBP should not be excluded. What have the big parties got to fear?

The TD for Dún Laoghaire was commenting following the announcement of the Central Banks’ Report announced today.

Richard Boyd Barrett TD said that the establishment a state not-for-profit insurance company was the only way to prevent this profiteering by insurance companies.

He also said that, at a minimum, the government should move to regulate and control the insurance industry properly to prevent unjustified and excessive premium increases.

The TD pointed out that a state insurance company has been set up in Manitoba Provence in Canada to ensure that people could get motor insurance at a fair price.

The TD also questioned if this profiteering practice was more widespread across other sectors such as childcare insurance and sports clubs.

He said: “The Central Bank Report confirms something People Before Profit have been saying for many years- the real reason for high insurance costs in this country is profiteering by the insurance companies rather than fraudulent claims.

“Fraud is problem that needs to be addressed but this report shows that the main issue is the greed of the insurance companies looking to maximise profits. Profiteering is the real problem and needs to be addressed head on by government.

“Young drivers and taxi drivers are being very seriously affected by this profiteering. In many cases for taxi drivers, it threatens their very livelihoods.

“The state should set up, as I have been calling for, a not-for-profit insurance company like in Manitoba Provence in Canada. The government at the very least should be regulating the insurance industry more strictly.

“Considering the very high cost of insurance for childcare services and sports clubs in this country I would ask that the Minister for Finance investigates whether or not these profiteering practices are being conducted by insurance companies in other sectors of the economy.”","102","https://www.facebook.com/peoplebeforeprofitofficial/posts/pfbid02aNs1VfsY74kkUfPQF6WL1EDCqmg8ctK6Da3EtRokar6TuHGHH4YtiPA1KpmDVpxrl"

It would take the average worker 200 years to earn what some Irish CEOs are getting.

This shocking fact has emerged from a study of the salary packages of 26 chief executives of major Irish companies.

CEOs get a package that consists of four elements – basic pay, a cash bonus, share options and big pension.

When these are put together 22 CEO of Ireland’s top 26 companies earn more than €1 million a year.

The best paid boss is Cement Roadstone Holding’s, Albert Manifold who gets an €8.23m pay package that would take an ordinary worker 212 years to earn.

The same company was at the centre of the Ansbacher scandal when most of its directors contributed to a special account used to bribe the former Fianna Fail leader, Charlie Haughey

These outrageous salaries contrast sharply with the fact that nearly a quarter of Irish workers are on low pay.

Irish workers have also massively increased their productivity – yet their pay has not risen to match it.

And in sharp contrast to the pension benefits that CEOs get, workers will have to work longer to even get a state pension. From 2021, the retirement age is due to rise to 67.

The justification used for the high earnings of CEOs is that they must be rewarded for their efforts to raise company profits. This, however, ignores the fact that it is workers to create those same profits – even though they see little reward for their efforts.

And even when a CEO presides over a loss-making corporation such as in Tullow Oil, they still walk away with golden handshakes of over €1 million.

The trade union movement needs to wake up to these startling facts and start pressing for higher wages for workers. 

The recession ended years ago – and workers need higher pay just to pay for rents, creche fees and even public transport.

We need to change our unions and demand that they start fighting for workers – with the same enthusiasm that Fine Gael and Fianna Fail look after their rich friends.","164","https://www.facebook.com/peoplebeforeprofitofficial/posts/pfbid02rgWjCa82rak1758nMPJhFLAK5LHDWEoeX32YaAqKctsgXVqn7biGTeZr1D4HiQz8l"

Speaking on behalf of Solidarity, Mick Barry TD stated:

“Workers must not be made pay the price for Brexit. This Budget puts no conditions on the bailout that many large firms will be getting. The only mention of workers in the Minister’s speech is provision for social protection payments for workers being laid off. There was no mention of the minimum wage increase which indicates an announcement on this in the coming weeks. The Minister accepts that some large businesses will receive grants, and at the same time be laying off workers. Jobs, pay and conditions must be safeguarded rather than accepting the logic of the capitalist market. We need state investment with many of the major agri-business companies brought under democratic public ownership.”

Wealth

“Despite the dangers posed by Brexit, climate change and the housing emergency, it hasn’t occurred to Fine Gael to levy emergency taxes on wealth and corporations. Wealth and the numbers of ‘high net worth’ individuals is at record levels. Taxing multinationals remains a taboo subject for Irish capitalism. Charging the full effective rate of corporation tax would bring in €2 billion this year. Doubling it — to the rate that exists in many other European countries — would raise €4 billion, enough to build 20,000 local authority houses. Introducing a 2% tax on the richest 5% could raise €3.25 billion. A financial transactions tax of 0.1% could pay for free public transport immediately.”

Carbon tax & climate change

“Carbon tax will only have a minimal impact on climate change and is a regressive tax which will increase fuel poverty. The Minister indicated his determination to quadruple the carbon tax over the coming years the inadequate provision to protect the most vulnerable form fuel poverty is concerning - €2 a week is the equivalent of half a bale of briquettes.

Rather than increase taxes on ordinary workers, there is a need to build a carbon free alternative economy. Public transport has not been allocated the funds needed to take cars off the road. The €384m rise in the Department of Transport budget will not cater for the extensions of rail, light rail, bus services and rural transport that we need. If the government was serious on climate change we would see fare free public transport which would cost in the region of €625m.

The government’s own Climate Action Plan has a target of 50,000 retrofitted homes per year. This Budget does nothing to properly fund this or train workers to deliver on this in the coming years.”

Housing

“This is a ‘Housing Must Wait’ Budget. Despite the crisis of rocketing rents and the inability of young people or families to secure mortgages or social homes, the routinist government response is shocking.

The amount allocated to build social housing was in line with previous budgets. Only two lines in the Minister’s speech dealt with rents.

Budget 2020 should have announced a public home building programme building tens of thousands of social and affordable homes by the local authorities.”

Childcare

“Parents are faced with the highest childcare costs in Europe. The Budget made no mention of assisting parents with childcare costs. The €54m announcement will cater for demographic changes. The national average cost of a 2-year-old in childcare is €745 per month; this rises to a cost of €1,047 per month in Dublin. We need to see childcare as a public service with high quality care and well-paid employment.”

Education

“This Budget’s announcements on Special Education Needs teachers, SNAs and mainstream teachers only keeps up with the demographic changes in the country. Only 1 in 10 schools will get a new SEN teacher. 1 in 4 schools will get a new SNA. Parents and pupils will continue to fight for basic access to education for special needs.

The Minister announced no change in the pupil/teacher ratio which is the highest in the Eurozone and no increase in the capitation grant for schools.

Third level students saw no assistance with the cost of college with no change made to the SUSI grant, no provision of much needed affordable student accommodation, and no increase in colleges’ core grant from the State.”

Social Protection

“It appears that Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael are happy to have the State pension frozen as the cost of living for the elderly rises. The lower rate of social protection payment for the Under 26s is maintained by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael for another year. This is no Budget for the most vulnerable in society.”

Health

“We are in the middle of a massive health care emergency. Last month over 10,000 patients went without a bed in hospitals while hundreds of thousands get sicker on growing waiting lists. Workers in healthcare are low paid and overstretched. The budget announcements will not even keep up with demographic changes and all the crises will continue to worsen. We need to see massive investment in public healthcare.”","17","https://www.facebook.com/solidarityie/posts/pfbid05BtWj8sRx6X2o4ncdmj2AjZwx9EY6ZyDDFkfpUN7KktK5ph4hVW3ztjHMMayA39Nl"

The staff and students of Carlow College, St Patrick’s are calling on the Minister for Justice, Charlie Flanagan to review the deportation case of a 1st year student, Michael Usiku. Michael came to study in Ireland five years ago but the two private colleges he attended in Dublin both closed down before he could complete his degree.

Michael applied for a place in Carlow College on the Social, Political and Community Studies programme so he could qualify and return to his native Malawi and work as a community worker.

However, his application for an extension to his student visa was denied, simply because the offer from Carlow College didn’t arrive in time. 

Michael was served with a deportation order last week by the Department of Justice, stating that he must leave Ireland by 29th December 2019. Only the Minister can revoke the deportation order and time is of the essence.

Michael is not a burden on the state and has self-financed his education in Ireland to date. The staff and students in Carlow College are calling on Minister Flanagan to review Michael’s case and lift the deportation order until he completes his degree. 

The campaign has garnered support locally and nationally, with the online petition gathering over 1000 signatures in just five days.

On Monday 9th Carlow County Council passed an emergency motion to write to the Minister for Justice to ask for the deportation order to be reversed.

The Union of Students in Ireland, which is the national representative body for third level students in Ireland, is also calling on Minister Flanagan to revoke the deportation order.

Further information about the campaign is available from Stephanie Hanlon, Lecturer on the Social, Political and Community Studies Programme in Carlow College.

No-deal Brexit budget
 must not mean attacks on working people

Trade Union movement
 should prepare to resist Brexit attacks

The fact that the Minister for Finance, Paschal Donohoe, is preparing for a budget premised on the basis of a no-deal Brexit is a message to working class people that the government is preparing to make them pay for the consequences of a no-deal Brexit. While signalling that there will not be anywhere near the investment necessary to resolve the crises in housing, health and education, the government is preparing to give big handouts to big business impacted by the crisis.

Of course, preparation for the impact of a no-deal Brexit is necessary, but it should be in a very different direction to that of the government. The bottom line is that working people must not suffer in terms of wages, conditions or public services. Where an industry like agriculture faces crisis, the state should step in to save jobs and incomes. However, this should not be on the basis of leaving the industry in the hands of meat industry bosses who are attempting to starve the farmers back, and who have just laid off 3,000 workers and are threatening 5,000 more jobs. Instead, it must be on the basis of bringing them into democratic public ownership. 

A real Brexit preparation budget introduced by a left government would be a budget based on socialist policies to transform society, making it economically and ecologically sustainable.That would mean breaking from the corporate tax haven model, which was exposed yet again by the IMF report on Monday which revealed that almost two-thirds of Foreign Direct Investment in Ireland is ‘phantom’. It also would mean investment in free public transport, renewable energy and sustainable agriculture.

The Trade Union movement should prepare its own ‘red lines’ for the upcoming budget and the impact of Brexit and prepare to organise workers to ensure that they suffer no loss of jobs or wages and that the necessary investment is made to resolve the social crises we face.”","20","https://www.facebook.com/solidarityie/posts/pfbid0EJo15th3tCCYc9TzpTKDDukujAbhK5zA1UYdaHGtrShfHHZEuDaEBLcgFbYTg43rl"

Solidarity TD Mick Barry this morning slammed the decision of Ireland’s beef processors to temporarily lay off 3000 workers at 20 plants across the state yesterday.

He said: “This was a cold-blooded and calculated decision to use 3000 workers as pawns in the meat industry’s ongoing dispute with the country’s beef farmers. At the weekend the industry walked out of talks with the farmers in an attempt to starve the farmers back to work. Yesterday they lay off thousands of workers. Who is driving this ruthless campaign? Some of the richest men in the country. They should not be allowed to keep doing what they are doing here.”

Deputy Barry said that he agreed with the workers’ trade union Siptu which has issued a statement placing the blame for the layoffs on the meat industry and calling on Meat Industry Ireland to reverse their decision to boycott the talks.

The Cork North Central deputy pointed out that in previous times of crisis workers had sat in and occupied their workplaces in places like Vita Cortex in Cork city to demand economic justice and said that such a step by 3000 laid off workers would be justified here in this instance.

Beef income currently breaks down on a 20-51-29 basis between farmers, retailers and beef processors.

Deputy Barry said that a bold move to take the beef industry into public ownership would allow a raising of the price paid to farmers for their beef by reducing profit margins.

He also said that a just transition to a more sustainable form of agriculture will never happen when the industry is controlled by ruthless profiteers but could be managed on the basis of democratic public ownership.","27","https://www.facebook.com/solidarityie/posts/pfbid0FgQd9dtkfVXGPTZwSvPPccE9t4ZmvQvPKx6uSCDDrzVXc8ovw8WMbCaGtE1u1NRhl"

Sinn Féin in Belfast have begun a dirty tricks campaign against People Before Profit. In a desperate effort to damage us late in the election, they have put up posters in our name in an effort to confuse people that these are PBP posters.

The posters say the name people before profit, but they do not include the name of the person who published the posters, or the place they were printed in, as per electoral rules.

Nor do they say anywhere that these are SF posters. This despite the fact that all other Sinn Féin posters include these details.

This is a flagrant effort by Sinn Féin, therefore, to ignore these regulations in order to try give the appearance that these posters are PBP posters.

People Before Profit posters attack the Tories. Sinn Féin's posters attack the main socialist force in West Belfast.

But Sinn Féin's desperate actions have proven one thing: they see People Before Profit as a threat, and that this election has become a two horse race. A vote for anyone else is a wasted vote in this election.

If you want to send a message to the political establishment, to those like Sinn Féin who voted in universal credit and PIP, who created the public sector pay freeze that people are striking against today, then the only way to do that is to vote socialist.

Vote People Before Profit.

Don't let them bully you.","140","https://www.facebook.com/peoplebeforeprofitofficial/posts/pfbid0339BA7dKBnbttx3VGZKvtoSoTCZeKHEgCHTvT8EEYu1hDYnusK4YD4dDfUjSWDMSxl"

Eoghan Murphy is a disgrace. He has allowed landlords to push up rents to over €500 a month for a single room in Dublin and surrounding areas.

He has told his officials to sell off public land to private speculators at knock down prices. And he has let homelessness become the new normal.

If he could blush with shame, he would have resigned long ago. And if the Dail really represented the will of the people, he would have been driven from office.

But Eoghan Murphy has survived his second no-confidence vote with the help off Fianna Fail and a  group of dodgy independents.

Fianna Fail’s rationale is straightforward. Like Fine Gael, one third of their TDs are landlords and so they have no real sympathy with the victims of the housing crisis.

The rogue’s gallery who backed Fine Gael include:

·         Michael Lowry, a tax dodger whom the McCracken Tribunal stated  was ’profoundly corrupt to a degree that was nothing short of breath taking.’

·         Noel Grealish, a racist who tried to smear African migrants to turn anger in rural Ireland away from the Fine Gael government he supports

·         Denis Naughton, who had to resign as Minister for Communications after it was revealed that he was having private dinners with the bidder for the broadband network.

This government will have to be driven from office by mass protests on the streets.

Get ready for it in the new year when there will be a major housing protest.","398","https://www.facebook.com/peoplebeforeprofitofficial/posts/pfbid02UQeA8BX5dRppb1vFrUzbXKpevsMEWpJNyvBUwfqGTuVTFZDFeQQiDjVCFxckQAsl"

Two children were alone with their mother’s body overnight in homeless accommodation in south Dublin last year.

They spent the night and most of the next day with their dead mother. 

Anne Marie Connors died of a drug overdose in Churchtown on the night of April 17th/18th, 2018.

Her body was found at 4pm on April 18th, along with her children then aged 10 and five, at Camberley House, owned and managed by Sophia Housing.

This terrible news comes on the back of a report showing that children in emergency accommodation are not meeting developmental milestones. 

Children raised in hotel rooms don’t have the space to learn to crawl. 

Meanwhile the landlord government sits on it’s hand and does nothing. 

That’s why we have to get out on the streets. 

We are calling on everyone to join the protest this Thursday called by housing activists. The protest is meeting at 12.30pm at Parnell Sq and then marching on the Dáil.

Mannix Flynn, a Dublin City Councilor, recently organised a residents meeting to oppose the building of a homeless hostel by the Peter McVerry Trust.

During the meeting he was challenged over his record on the housing crisis and promptly ordered the speaker to be ejected.

He then pointed to Peter Dooley and declared that as he was a People Before Profit member, he also should also be removed from the public meeting. Peter Dooley had said nothing.

Despite this blatant witch-hunting, councilors who were present from other parties did not object to this disgraceful behavior. After the meeting, Mannix Flynn made a physical threat against Peter Dooley.

He has a particular venom for People Before Profit because he was almost removed from his position as a councilor by a PBP candidate in the local election. He survived by just 4 votes.

The South Inner City of Dublin has huge problems because Dublin City Council has consistently refused to build social housing in the area or properly re-furbish the flats.

Instead the council has deliberately embarked on a policy of allowing hotel and student accommodation to be built. Flynn has a poor record when it comes to fighting on these issues.

He voted to sell off council land at 24 Harcourt Road and 1 and 2 South Richmond Street in Dublin 2 to Charledev Properties DAC  – rather than using it for social housing.

It would be much better if proper social housing were built in the area- rather than a homeless hostel.

But it was Flynn and others who voted against this policy. People Before Profit will continue to speak out against this record.","408","https://www.facebook.com/peoplebeforeprofitofficial/posts/pfbid0hczi3nsnp1jGZ9U4nBzLoqtbh5JrjgM58j2EmCf99jCaTD2JQp9XeBdPfrhXTBiKl"

Using our collective people power, we can build a new, united Irish Republic that cherishes all of its children equally. By connecting people and showing solidarity with each other, we can transform Irish society and end the partition of Ireland.

Partition has failed consecutive generations of Irish people; partition has prevented our entire island from reaching its true social, economic and cultural potential.  A divided and partitioned Ireland can only perpetuate the cycle of division. We aim to unite Ireland and its people.

We hope to welcome you, your friends and families to Lifford and Strabane on Sunday 24th November for the March for Irish Unity. The March will send out a clear message from peaceful, anti-sectarian, grass roots Republicanism that a united Ireland will generate a transformative power on which a new republic can be built.

Assemble for 1pm at The Diamond in Lifford, Co Donegal, Sunday 24th November for the March into Abercorn Square, Strabane, Co Tyrone.

March for Irish Unity is a non-party political, grassroots, anti-sectarian and peaceful initiative aimed at mobilising the collective and vibrant Irish Unity Community for a new and United Ireland.

“No blacks, no dogs, no Irish!” read the signs in Britain in the 1970s. 

The history of Ireland as a victim of Empire meant Irish workers were often the target of racism in Britain. 

But because of that it was hard for nasty far right groups to grow in Ireland – the working people of Ireland have always shown an instinctive solidarity to other oppressed peoples around the world. 

That’s why we were known as a place of a ‘thousand welcomes’, a reputation we should fight to keep. 

There is a nasty hard racist minority who want to change that. 

The extremist Catholic far right, after losing the Repeal referendum, have begun targeting migrants and asylum seekers. 

These people will use concern about local services to stir up racist sentiment against poor people who are forced to live in horrible direct provision centres. 

They will try to blame immigration for a housing crisis that was created by the bank bailout, NAMA, developers, vultures and right-wing establishment politicians – who refuse to build public housing. 

There are 200,000 empty properties in this country and we are owed €19 billion by Apple alone. There is no reason why we can’t house everyone. 

They will incite hatred and encourage acts of violence against people of colour – just look at what happened in Finglas this month when a racist drove his car into a father waiting at a school. 

This nasty minority are being encouraged by establishment politicians who use dog whistle politics to get media attention and votes. 

People Before Profit want to unite all workers and poor people in the fight for a decent society for all. That’s why we’re supporting the big anti-racist protest called for Dec 14th. 

The protest will see dozens of community, union, left and faith groups uniting to stand against racism and hate. Join the protest 1pm Sat Dec 14th Dáil Eireann.","93","https://www.facebook.com/peoplebeforeprofitofficial/posts/pfbid02Q7zinyUF7Zh6fiHiiFXv7wd3Mx6Au7o3mHHJB5eRokg9Yyd5g29HDwuV4Qmk3W7Fl"

Councillors from Fianna Fail, the Green Party, Labour and the Social Democrats all voted to give land at O'Devaney Gardens to Bartra Capital.

The deal was supposed to see 30% set to be ""affordable"" - costing €310,000 euros. 

Another 20% were ring-fenced for social housing – but Bartra would charge the council high fees to build these. A further 30% were promised to be sold by Bartra to a housing body.

But now housing Minister Eoghan Murphy has stated there are no funds for the plan and that councillors didn’t consult his department – meaning the councillors lied about having a deal! 

There is no funding for affordable rental accommodation being provided by the Department of Housing and that there was no request for such funding from the above councillors.

So even if Dublin City Council bought 30% of the units from Bartra the price they would be buying them at is so high that they’d be rented at market rates and so unaffordable to most people!

The is scandalous – the councillors of the mainstream parties voted for a rotten deal to gift public land to a private developer while buying back housing from that developer. 

Now the government says there’s no funding to buy back those units!

There are over 10,000 people homeless, tens of thousands in mortgage arrears and tens of thousands more paying exorbitant rents. 

But as long as our local councils and the government is dominated by the establishment parties and those willing to go into coalition with them we will never get the mass public housing build we need. 

That’s why you need to vote radical left in the by-elections. 

And that’s why we will be supporting the housing protest called for Dec 5th at 12 noon at the Garden of Remembrance Dublin.","170","https://www.facebook.com/peoplebeforeprofitofficial/posts/pfbid0nnT2GGiiZWW55MhKf9d9WJPvXURxndER4x3sygaEL3GndMkcXr2g1CNGUDJ9oqU4l"

Boil notices for water have just ended for over 600,000 people in Dublin. But it is already clear that similar notices are likely to be imposed again.

Meanwhile, in other parts of the country sewerage from 77,000 people is flowing into our environment every day, sometimes contaminating the water supply.

Towns affected include Kilmore Quay Arklow and Cobh.

Water treatment plants in Ireland are simply not up standard, as a recent report from the Environmental Protection Agency indicates.

21 cities including the largest two, Dublin and Cork, have water treatment facilities that are not up to EU standards.

Fine Gael are trying to blame this situation on the refusal of people to pay water charges. If you don’t pay for water, they claim, you will get a poor quality service.

In reality, the problem stems from decades of under-investment. This was a deliberate state policy as they were preparing to follow the British model and turn water services over to private companies.

This strategy is seen in figures produced by Irish Water itself. Between 2004 and 2009, the average spend on capital investment was €423 million. But this then dropped to €382 million between 2010 and 2013.

To make matters worse, Irish Water was set up as a Public Utility Model, with the expectation that 51 percent of its funding was to come from private finances.

It embarked on a major programme of metering, wasting a staggering €1 billion in installing these devices. It should instead have been investing in the water infrastructure, closing off the leaks that accounted for 40% of water loss and improving the water treatment plants.

The result today is a totally inadequate water service. In the case of Leixlip, for example, there has been some upgrading of the water treatment in one part of the plant.

But the older part is extracting water from the River Liffey and its filter systems are inadequate.

Any bad weather or ‘turbulence’ can cause organic matter to be washed into the plant – causing boil water notices.

Irish Water services require a major investment to improve quality. We already pay for this through high taxes on PAYE workers.

Ahead of next weekend’s Sinn Fein Ard Fheis, the Donegal TD Pearse Doherty has stated that the party is willing to talk to either Fine Gael/or Fianna Fail about forming a government after next year’s election in the South.

‘We're open to it, if those parties are willing to come on board, with a proper progressive policy platform’, he said.

There is, however, a problem.

No matter what the ‘progressive’ window dressing is, FF and FG want to maintain Ireland as a tax haven for big business.

Both these parties are willing to pay out millions to legal firms to stop Ireland receiving 13 billion euros that Apples owes us in tax.

They preside over a situation where multi-nationals and native Irish companies pay a tiny amount of tax – proportionately well below what the average worker pays.

The failure to make corporations pay tax helps to explain why Ireland has such poor public services.

The other major aim of FF and FG is to support a native business elite who increasingly rely on property speculation.

Not surprisingly, one in three of their TDs are landlords – which helps to explain why there are no proper rent controls.

The plain reality is that FG and FF do not want Sinn Fein in coalition. They would prefer to have the softer, more house trained liberals of Labour or the Greens.

But if the numbers were right and Sinn Fein could guarantee stability they might, somewhat reluctantly, accept.

What is shocking, however, is that Sinn Fein deploys a left wing rhetoric on occasions – but has told us in advance that they will use their votes to prop up a right wing led government, if they get an opportunity.

There can be no change in Ireland as long as FF or FG run the government.

And has long as there is no radical change, the prospect of ending partition becomes far or difficult to achieve.","125","https://www.facebook.com/peoplebeforeprofitofficial/posts/2532789906812521"

It takes a socialist to stand up to the Tories. The big parties who have voted through Tory Welfare Reforms cannot be trusted. If elected, I will challenge Boris and his nasty policies, from his vision for Brexit to his plans for the NHS. I will fight for my community, for our health service, for the environment, and to put a socialist alternative on the agenda ✊""

Councilors from Fianna Fail, the Green Party, Labour and the Social Democrats have agreed to give land at O'Devaney Gardens to Bartra Capital.

O'Devaney Gardens was a working class flat complex on the edge of the Phoenix Park. For decades, it was run down by Dublin City Council and requests by tenants for proper maintenance were ignored.

Dublin City Council officials typically neglect inner city housing complexes in the hope that they can eventually move out the residents and turn them into posh private apartments.

The Fianna Fail-Green-Labour-Social Democrat coalition that run Dublin City Council complied with this disgraceful strategy.

They are letting Bartra build 768 houses and apartments on the site. Half of these will be private and these will fetch a very high price because of its location.

30% are set to be ""affordable"". But the council’s definition of affordable is a house that costs 310,000 euros. That is nine times the average annual wage –and is not ‘affordable’ to the majority.

Another 20% are ring-fenced for social housing – but Bartra will charge the council high fees to build these. A further 30% are promised to be made available for sale by Bartra to a housing body. 

The majority coalition held a private meeting with Bartra and were given a vague promise that some of the private houses would be sold to an approved housing body.

However, in the actual resolution that was passed, this was presented as a ‘request’ from an elected council to a private-for profit-company.

Bartra, which is led by Richard Barrett, is one of the most profit hungry companies now operating in Dublin’s housing market.

In Dun Laoghaire, for example, they are pushing a scheme of ‘co-living’ where up to 40 people will have to share a communal kitchen. 

By agreeing to this disgraceful deal, the Greens and the Social Democrats join Labour in the long list of parties that sell out working class people.

Their vote is a signal of what will happen on a national level.

The votes of Labour, Green and Social Democrats will be used to prop up a Fianna Fail led coalition.

We have been warned.","285","https://www.facebook.com/peoplebeforeprofitofficial/posts/pfbid02pNjNhYDDScNmf8jWS49c2wNv781iDCwoqAZ2EA2XHRHfq1C5kSShCUsA1pKqmS2Gl"

Language teachers at Delfin English Language School, in Dublin have been on strike since September 23rd. They have held a series of stoppages lasting  half a day, one day and two days in support of their demands for union recognition, a pay increase, payment for all hours worked and proper holiday pay. This is an historic dispute as this is the first official dispute at a language school and the first school to have 100% union membership. The teachers are members of UNITE.

According to UNITE management  have totally failed to address the concerns of the workforce in relation to three main areas of contention: the need for pay to reflect the increased cost of living, the volume of unpaid work done by English Language Teachers on a daily basis, and the fact that teachers are left with no choice but to sign on for social welfare payments over the Christmas period.

The management refuses to engage with the union and recognise UNITE.

Part time lecturers in Institutes of Technology, some of whom are teaching languages, including English, get over €60 an hour. Workers in Delfin get less than a third of that.

This is an important dispute that must be won. Workers in the industry and across the movement must get behind the Delfin strikers. Get motions passed in your union supporting them and contribute to their strike fund. Send donations to Unite the Union. Middle Abbey Street, Dublin1, made out to the Unite the Union earmarking the donation for the Delfin Strikers.","26","https://www.facebook.com/peoplebeforeprofitofficial/posts/pfbid036npozPzQyExaftBrGREPFA84VE4ZdrpQpoxGqq9nVK3jVgxpySZKCjkKdLmP5qvgl"

Shaun has a proven track record of standing up for ordinary people and won't let you down. 

People Before Profit Foyle candidate Shaun Harkin:

""The Tories have ruled the roost for the last decade with contempt for ordinary people. The DUP shamefully propped them up to continue the attack on public services, welfare, workers rights, the environment and threaten a hard border. Boris Johnson embodies Westminster's failed democracy and the elitism of the rich and powerful. He needs to go. We want to bring Tory/DUP rule to an end for good. .

People Before Profit can be trusted to vote to scrap welfare reform, undo anti-trade union laws, reverse privatisation of public services and resist any attempt to reimpose a hard border here. We'll vote to increase taxes on billionaires. We'll vote to stop corporations from polluting the planet. 

All the establishment parties in the North are complicit in implementing Tory policies through Stormont. They voted to bring in vicious welfare reforms. They voted to cut taxes on corporations. They refused to undo Tory anti-trade union laws. They have overseen the privatisation of the NHS, the running down of our schools, the destruction of the Housing Executive and disastrous environment policies. They assisted the DUP's effort to block equality for women and LGBT+ community. 

Establishment parties here can't be trusted to end Tory rule. They can't be trusted to stand up to corporations and climate polluters. They can't be trusted to stand up for ordinary people. 

Every vote for People Before Profit is a vote for a socialist Ireland, for an alternative to Unionism and Nationalism and for an end to elitist Westminster rule."" 

On December 12 Vote Shaun Harkin in to get Boris Johnson and the Tories out.

On Wednesday 6th November the Dail will debate a People before Profit motion that can restore some basic democracy to this country.

The motion will prevent the Government using a procedural trick called the ""money message"" that has stopped over 55 new laws being passed so far.

The money message is a part of the Dail's rules or Standing Orders. It means they can block any Bill their friends in big business or the fossil fuel industry don't like.This rule is meant to comply with a Constitutional clause that says only the Government can spend or appropriate public money.

However, the mechanism is being used to block all bills, even bills that have no direct cost to the state or only small incidental costs.

That's not what the constitutional clause was for, but it is how Fine Gael is using this rule to block every bill they don't like. This is despite these new laws winning a clear majority of TDs in a vote in the Dail.

If this motion is passed then the Government can no longer:
- Block a new Anti Evictions bill that will stop landlords evicting people on spurious grounds
- Or block a ban on fossil fuel exploration that the Climate Movement so desperately demands
- Or block new rights for workers on pensions and redundanciesor continue blocking access to medicinal cannabis
- Or stopping the rights of parents to give their children non religious sex education in schools.

In all over 55 new laws could be passed if we unblock democracy on November 6th  Please support us by emailing your TD and join our protest outside the Dail , Kildare St 5.30pm on Wed 6th. 

Join with others fighting for a better climate, a better and fairer society and real action on the housing crisis.","109","https://www.facebook.com/peoplebeforeprofitofficial/posts/pfbid02tsR42589cwE6dF8eq4ajZWNS7jPcuuN73ArzK3y7G86brMzBDryAp3SUJnDaDbTZl"

Climate change needs to be tackled in a progressive way that combines social justice and fairness with the obvious environmental needs.
For the last decade, the EU and Ireland’s approach to climate change has failed by allowing big polluters a cheap way out.  Market solutions haven’t worked.  Carbon taxes don’t work.

It’s time we stopped big oil and gas companies having free reign in the European Parliament and ended their influence on Climate Change policy.

Questions remain over use on private US based labs. 

Recent audit report of 221 cases highlight huge discrepancies in rates of misread slides between Private and Public labs says Bríd Smith TD

The Taoiseach’s apology today to the families and members of the 221 group, while welcome, would be largely rhetorical unless the state takes responsibility for its past errors says People Before Profit TD Bríd Smith.

The TD said that the recent audit of the slides of the 221 women involved showed that there was “a large and striking difference” between the rates of misread slides at US based labs such and Quest and CPL compared to the one public lab, The Coombe.

“I understand the limitations in these figures, but a genuine apology should start by looking at these figures and admitting that the decision in 2008 to outsource this service to private labs in another country with little if any oversight or control was a serious error. Making cheaper costs in private labs the main criteria in awarding contacts was also unconscionable.”

The TD also highlighted the jarring contradiction of the state issuing a formal apology while it still denies responsibility for the quality of the work done in private labs.

“The best sign that we have learnt the lessons in this tragedy would be for the state to commit to repatriating the service fully to public labs and to drop their pursuit of Ruth Morrissey in the courts and concede that ultimately the State is responsible for the work done when it contacts out such a vital service for women’s health,” she said.","93","https://www.facebook.com/peoplebeforeprofitofficial/posts/pfbid02449JF9G3Uj4RixyKs5HRCVtkECL4LjC5A3xeayQsCJ7at3oWpdVw9JDAfzUSg9L4l"

Remember today when they say you cannot change anything. That nothing ever changes, that things always stay the same, especially in this part of the world. Things are changing and will change today for  Women and the LGBT community here. 

The reason why change is happening is down to the activism and campaigning  of so many people over so many years. People Before Profit have been proud to stand alongside people in the fight for both equal marriage and abortion access, rights that they should have access to long ago. 

Somebody once said that ""Power concedes nothing without a demand"" and today that echoes right across society here. 

Our society is eventually moving in the right direction, and today's changes can hopefully begin to make where we live a more just and fair place, especially for oppressed and marginalised communities. 

No doubt there are many battles ahead still to fight to make this happen but those fights will be strengthened by the changes implemented today, changes that Westminster where forced to implement because of continuous activism over the years of many people.

The deplorable attempt to re-establish Stormont on Monday is nothing more than a hypocritical stunt. 

Not once did the DUP call for Stormont to be re-established to deal PIP or Universal Credit which have been crippling communities across the North, or to deal with the crisis in our health or education systems. 

We find it disgusting, therefore, that this stunt has been scrambled to try to block the reproductive rights of people across the North. Those rights have been denied for far too long. It is time for reproductive justice. 

We welcome the fact that other parties will not join Monday’s circus on the hill but to those parties we issue one warning: do not backtrack on this issue. Do not enter future negotiations with the DUP in order to seriously limit access to abortion. 

The right to free, safe, legal and local abortion should not be up for negotiation. Nor should Irish language rights or the right to equal marriage. Any political or sectarian horse trading of rights will no doubt be met will disgust and protest from those who have shamefully been denied them for too long.

We are resolutely opposed to it, and support moves to avert such a scenario.

We do not accept, however, that it is Boris Johnson's deal or nothing. The threat of a no deal Brexit cannot be used to railroad through an agreement that is not in the interests of working class people.

People Before Profit will look through the detail of the latest deal between the British government and the EU. We are concerned that the deal will strengthen efforts by the Tories to enact a race to the bottom, and potentially open doors to a regressive agreement between Donald Trump and Boris Johnson that could lead to the erosion of public services.

We are also concerned that the proposal to subject custom rules to a vote every four years in the NI Assembly will further entrench sectarianism and could potentially lead to a hardening of the border in future.

The Tories do not command a majority in parliament, and they have no mandate to negotiate on behalf of people in Ireland. People Before Profit would like to see a no deal scenario definitively ruled out, and an immediate general election called, to allow people the opportunity to bring the Tory government down.","46","https://www.facebook.com/peoplebeforeprofitofficial/posts/pfbid0ee7h4y8ZCkncFGmZLkybTz9xt4ghe5kBRWLMjJ1JweZa4fdVUNBbA3ZzdQBWdCeEl"

The courts of the Spanish state today handed down horribly repressive sentences against the leaders of the Catalan pro-independence movement for the ‘crime’ of organising a democratic vote.

The prosecution had sought up to 25 years in prison for Oriol Junqueras, the former vice-president of Catalonia and the highest-ranking pro-independence leader on trial.

Junqueras was handed the longest sentence of 13 years for sedition and misuse of public funds.

Others to receive prison sentences for sedition were:

    Dolors Bassa, former Catalan labour minister (12 years)

    Jordi Turull, former Catalan government spokesman (12 years)

    Raül Romeva, former Catalan external relations minister (12 years)

    Carme Forcadell, ex-speaker of the Catalan parliament (11.5 years)

    Joaquim Forn, former Catalan interior minister (10.5 years)

    Josep Rull, former Catalan territorial minister (10.5 years)

    Jordi Sànchez, activist and ex-president of the Catalan National Assembly (9 years)

    Jordi Cuixart, president of Catalan language and culture organisation Òmnium Cultural (9 years)

These sentences show the contempt of the Spanish state for the democratic rights of the Catalan people and its willingness to resort to brutal repression in order to deny them their right to self determination. They are evidence of the fact that the legacy of Francoist fascism is alive and well in that state. It is also clear that the EU leaders are complicit in this – they back the Spanish state against the rights of the Catalan people.

It is to be expected and hoped that the Catalan people and their allies will respond to this latest outrage with mass resistance. People Before Profit stands in solidarity with that resistance.

Currently the families have a medical cause of death, however no verdict on this cause.

To simply say someone died from smoke inhalation, or as a result of shock from severe burns, is to remove all context from how these injuries were sustained.  

This victory was not granted by the government, but was won by the Stardust Survivors, and the families of those who were burned to death as a result of The practice of chaining fire exits.

People before profit would like to congratulate all those who have campaigned for the last 38 years, for this victory.  We would also like to reiterate our ongoing support to all those who continue to suffer as a result of the Stardust Disaster”

Background information

The official inquiry into the disaster found that the Stardust owners had acted with “reckless disregard” for the safety of their customers, but no charges were ever brought against them. The owners cynically claimed that the fire was as a result of arson, so that they could win substantial damages for the loss of the nightclub complex.

The arson claim inflicted further pain on the families, of those who had died, and the survivors, because it cast suspicion on all those attending the Nightclub.

The owners received their compensation in 1983 while those who were injured had to fight on for 8 more years before receiving anything.","61","https://www.facebook.com/peoplebeforeprofitofficial/posts/pfbid02k3f5dc5M7udJZ18vzghqzaxhJQScrYynoHfuS4nnfqkKwKpkHg5LFUzMnaaRCRzdl"

Boris Johnson wants to erect a string of customs posts along the Irish border.

He even wants to set up a large ’northern clearance site’ to track goods moving back and forth across the Irish border to a ‘southern clearance site’.

These proposals are contained in a series of proposals sent to the EU – which are, bizarrely, known as ‘non-papers’.

The RTE correspondent, Tommy Gorman, was right when, in a shocked voice, he stated that any Irish government that accepted this would be driven out of office.

Yet the Irish government is already playing a dangerous game.

They are going along with Juncker’s demand that EU border post be erected on the Southern side. But this only gives Johnson an excuse to erect similar posts on the Northern side.

It is time to break from this softly, softly policy of sheltering behind the EU.

The Dail should issue a call to people living in both the South and the North to embark on a  campaign of non-violent civil disobedience to take down as many of customs posts as possible.

Johnson must be told that he will be met with mass popular resistance.

To be consistent, the Irish government should also inform the EU that none of its officials will co-operate in erecting posts.

Given Johnson’s brazen disregard for the feelings of people on this island, there must also be a clear change to tack to advance the only long term solution to all this mess – a border poll that enables the creation of  a united Ireland.","102","https://www.facebook.com/peoplebeforeprofitofficial/posts/pfbid0nH58HkhLq5ZnmkSesmMRadAc5aaCAVSVCCt82m7qZjbetkLDZcJv99rojeuK7nFsl"

Parents throughout the country are paying an average of €184 per week for full-time child care.

But the costs are far higher in Dublin. In Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown parents of a child under one year could expect to be charged €265 per week for full-time care.

It shows that Ireland’s system of relying on private providers, a low paid workforce and state subsidies is not working.

The Irish Childcare System is badly underfunded and extremely expensive.

According to the OECD’s Education at a Glance Report 2017, Irish expenditure on early year’s education amounts to only 0.1% of GDP (or 0.5% when over three year olds are included), significantly below the OECD average of 0.8%.

The highest levels of expenditure were recorded in the Nordic Countries which invest between 1.3% and 1.9% of GDP in early year’s education annually. 

This inevitably puts pressure on parents who use private operators to meet their childcare needs.

According to Eurostat, however, 37.7% of parents identified financial concerns as a major impediment to accessing childcare facilities compared with just 0.7% in Sweden and Denmark.

Meanwhile, a survey of 3,000 childcare workers found the average hourly wage is a little over €10 an hour. The net result is an expensive system that puts pressure on families and childcare professionals alike. 

Our alternative is to move towards Scandinavian levels of funding via a state run model of childcare. To do this, we would spend an extra billion split between newly hired state childcare workers and increased capacity in a national childcare system.

We would provide current childcare with a clear option to move into a state system and secure decent wages for those who work in this sector","45","https://www.facebook.com/peoplebeforeprofitofficial/posts/pfbid074zPaqVPER1EQWaxZSPmfBTQM7FWRnLxzy5Tp97rGSVEWhR3zv7dDf79XNxjYfRcl"

Despite all the talk of avoiding a hard border, the threat has grown rapidly in recent days. It started when the EU President, Juncker, stated categorically that the EU would insist on putting up border posts.

Varadkar then declared that he would follow through on EU orders by stating that if Britain ‘leaves on WTO terms, then it will be necessary to have checks and controls at the ports and the airports and some near the Border as well’.

The Irish government has been warning that border posts would threaten peace on this island. But now suddenly, they are agreeing to erect border posts to protect the EU single market.

But why is this ‘protection’ more important than maintaining peace and lessening the impact of partition?

People Before Profit has repeatedly warned that if posts are erected on the Southern side  of the border, they will quickly be followed by tit for tat moves on the Northern side.

A recent statement from Sammy Wilson shows exactly why this will become a reality. He is already demanding that border posts be erected on the Northern side to protect its businesses.

In reality, this arch-Unionist is using the issue to strengthen partition – even as opinion polls show, for the first time, a possible majority voting for a united Ireland.

We need urgent political pressure to halt this slide towards a hard border.

The Irish government should be telling the EU that its officials will not co-operate in any way with erecting border posts.

And Wilson and his Tory friend Johnson should be told that there will be mass peaceful civil disobedience to take down many of the border posts they erect.","50","https://www.facebook.com/peoplebeforeprofitofficial/posts/pfbid0699drvQVYZFNLBpuikwN7uwvawau4HjuGw8VDsPNSg1Qsa84yeF8js8BvsdYZ2U6l"

Rents in Dublin are rising by 7 percent on an annual basis. The average is now €1,713 a month which is a rise of €114 compared to three months ago. The figures show that the government policy of rent pressure zones is not working.

It was never meant to work – it was PR spin from a failed government because it provided a series of loopholes which allowed landlords to push up rents. They can use  the excuse of ‘substantial improvements’ to evict tenants and charge higher rents for new arrivals.

The government did not even introduce a public rental register so that new tenants could check that the rent had not risen by over 4 percent.

People are now paying so much rent that they cannot save to buy a house. House prices have also risen dramatically because Fine Gael refuse to take any measures to control the price of land.

The normally moderate ESRI has slammed the government for not imposing a  proper vacant site levy to stop land speculation. It is currently set at only 3% which is well below the value that a speculator gets for just sitting on it.

Professor Kieran McQuinn from the ESRI summed up what is happening by voicing the speculators' prevailing view on hoarding land:

 ""Why would I go to the hassle of trying to build properties or increase housing supply on the land that I own when I witness the cost and value of that land going up year on year?""

We need proper rent controls, security for tenants, and controls on the price of building land to reduce property prices.","111","https://www.facebook.com/peoplebeforeprofitofficial/posts/pfbid02fUiLww66u38UPpNGfptxFu9VJzAgKw86wiauiG6Ym3KT9HHHDaozGMpfv4S3H9Wrl"

Ryan Tubridy is an over-paid jerk – and has always been. He gets €495,000 a year for talking on radio. Most of time the time he is the background chatter that is RTE One’s morning offering.

But he has gone completely over the top in attacking Greta Thunberg, suggesting that ‘she should be brought home and watch a movie’.

Greta Thunberg is apparently upsetting his guests. ‘It's one thing campaigning, it's another thing causing anxiety to a generation’, he says.

But it is not Greta Thunberg who is causing anxiety – it is the prospect of the planet burning that is terrifying many young people. Tubridy is literally blaming the messenger for pointing to the reality.

To make matters even worse, he even suggested that she has a problem with her mental health. This amateur psychologist came to this conclusion after watching ‘her face contorted in pain’.

Ryan Tubridy should not just apologise. His salary should be cut – and maybe some of it devoted to research on climate denial.","726","https://www.facebook.com/peoplebeforeprofitofficial/posts/pfbid02JxYP9FzDXTTQoWQRU1Xn9VvbaJ2vpcE8eCyP7dqpB69LT5zgWAri9cTAkU6PqfU7l"

The President of the EU Commission, Jean Claude Juncker has stated categorically that the EU will insist that border posts be erected between the North and South of Ireland.

This is a direct betrayal of what he said when he was given a platform to address the Dail on 21 June 2018.

Then he was asked directly by Richard Boyd Barret TD the following:

‘Will President Juncker give us a clear commitment that the European Union will not impose a border, customs posts or any other infrastructure of a frontier to protect European borders in the way he is doing to the detriment and loss of life of people in the Mediterranean? That is the question. We do not trust the Tories. Can we trust you?'

To which Juncker answered ‘Yes;’ and received applause from the assembled deputies.

Now just over a year later, he has done an about turn and stated that the EU will insist on border posts.

This is not just an abject betrayal by the EU President – it is as clear an indication of the power relations between Ireland and the EU.

The EU have used the Irish border as a negotiating lever against the British. Once it has served its purpose, they drop all support for Irish aspirations to stop a hard border.

For the past number of years, Fine Gael- and their allies in Fianna Fail – have suggested that the EU are out best allies in resisting a  hard border. They have repeatedly – and correctly pointed out – that a hard border in Ireland will endanger the peace of this island.

So how can they now go along with orders from Brussels?

For the Irish government is already indicating that it will obediently do what it is told – even if it threatens peace.

Both the EU and the Irish government will claim that they ae not to blame for imposing this border – the responsibility lies with Britain.

But once they erect border posts on the Southern side, this will give the British Tories the excuse to follow suit. It will not matter then who started it – we will have to live with a strengthened form of partition.

We need clear public pressure to push the Irish government into changing tact.

They should tell the EU that no Irish state official will co-operate with any effort to impose a border.

Peace on this island could depend on it.","154","https://www.facebook.com/peoplebeforeprofitofficial/posts/pfbid0pudz4t4VmKqvjbKt818nRivgfSdCHkJBbi3VU3F6sn3ZxUsDMiLJe6bfbmgoaf4cl"

The full force of the political establishment is being deployed to break the beef protests.

RTE has stepped up its propaganda; Kepak meats has held back a €6 million investment and thousands of workers have been laid off.

Behind this, stands the powerful hand of the meat processing industry. Yet while attention has been focused on the farmers who are protesting, few are talking about the corporations who have cut the living standards of farmers and workers.

For every €10 spent on beef, the retailers get €5.10, the processors get €2.90 and the farmer gets just €2.00.

The average annual income for beef farmers in 2017 was just €12,529.

Meat industry workers are treated no better.

In 2015, Meat Industry Ireland made a submission to the Low Pay Commission arguing against any increase in the minimum wage.

They often operate a system of roll over contracts where workers are employed by sub-contractors and let go regularly before they gain a legal entitlement to a permanent job.

Meat Industry Ireland (MII) has said it doesn’t know the profit margin of the thirteen Irish meat processing companies it represents.

But companies like ABP, owned by Larry Goodman, Dawn, Kepak are making fantastic profits as Ireland becomes a major global exporter of beef.

Last year, ABP, for example, made €175 million in profits but Goodman has routed much of his wealth through Luxembourg to help avoid taxes.

These companies are at the root of the crisis in the Irish beef sector. They are stepping up pressure on farmers by using laid off workers as their hostages.

We need to break their grip over Irish society and its food production.

The meat processors should be taken into public ownership.

A fair basic price should be guaranteed to farmers.

With public support, there needs to be a just transition so that farmers who wish to exit beef production can be guaranteed a decent standard of living.","92","https://www.facebook.com/peoplebeforeprofitofficial/posts/pfbid0RQv2sE7oQbSZa6UfZNQviu7b5pewehxCyfzKa6cA2eLgUX6By58hWVUZrMx3W9hul"

The Apple corporation has been forced to pay over €14 billion to the Irish people – but Fine Gael and Fianna Fail want to hand back the money.

It is pure hypocrisy. They talk of a ‘rainy day’ budget to protect the Irish economy from the effects of Brexit – but they will not take the Apple money.

But why should PAYE workers and social welfare recipients be asked to make sacrifices – when a massive corporation like Apple is let get way with a tax rate of less than 1% on its profits?

The government has already spent €7 million of taxpayers money to well healed legal firms – to stop us getting hold of money owed to us.

And it gets worse.

Once they lose their initial case, the Irish government intends to make a further appeal. Their hope is that the legal case will drag on for years. But this also means that the coffers of the legal firms will be filled up with taxpayers’ money.

The Irish government should drop this case immediately and insist Apple pay the taxes it owes.","272","https://www.facebook.com/peoplebeforeprofitofficial/posts/pfbid0hm5SNnj7WigjinPcRYu7aF2ezChKekBz6jv3jHB3YqyDVmxXKS2yAGWc1rExggjMl"

The Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces Vice-Admiral Mark Mellet thinks that soldiers do not have a right to join the Irish Congress of Trade Unions
.
He claims that if PDFORA, the soldiers’ unions, are allowed to link up with the wider trade union movements, it would have ‘potential security implications for the state’.

Which only begs the question -what sort of state is frightened to give soldiers a basic freedom of association?

The Irish state keeps soldiers in a state of subjugation so that it can get away with paying poverty wages.

The families of soldiers have had to come out of protest on their behalf. One of the spokespersons for the Wives and Partners of the Defences Forces put it like this:

‘Our families live in poverty. We suffer from food, income, fuel, and child poverty. Many of us can only dream of owning our home, and some this month are facing uncertainty about their homes, while others are facing homelessness. I personally know these people’

In the last three years, 2,890 personnel of all ranks have left, representing an exodus of approximately 30% of the Defence Forces’ overall strength.

The soldiers want to join the ICTU because this is where negotiations on their wages are conducted.

Under Ireland’s bizarre form of social partnership, a few representatives from the ICTU Public Sector Committee join with government officials in negotiating rates of pay and even conditions for tens of thousands of public servants.

Soldiers should have a right to be represented there.

But we go further – they should also have a right to strike like every other worker.

Soldiers in Sweden have that right – and, strangely, the state has not fallen apart.

Soldiers in Ireland should have full union rights, including the right to strike.","159","https://www.facebook.com/peoplebeforeprofitofficial/posts/pfbid02gmXEjXSczMVEgbKJJrnZYBBf6Wn5hGKz5xCoQzpZQZ5sooWQ4ba11TbpUJNZwkHel"

Pascal Donohoe has said that there will be no tax cuts for PAYE workers because of Brexit.

But Fine Gael will continue tax cut for company executives who are earning millions.

In 2012, Fine Gael Minister Michael Noonan introduced a Special Assignee Relief Programme which cut the tax bill of senior executives.

If they came to Ireland they could cut their tax bill and even get an allowance for sending their children to a private school.

If they earned over €75,000 a year, their tax bill would be cut by 30% - just like that.

And the reason? Because they were company executives flying into Ireland from a global corporation.

Last year 793 individuals availed of the scheme and four of them had an annual income of over €3 million.
 
With the tax cut, they made a ‘saving’ of €1 million each.
 
Welcome to Fine Gael’s corporate paradise.","224","https://www.facebook.com/peoplebeforeprofitofficial/posts/pfbid0mat9RAxHC3Lduz95Nada8n8zWtF5KtVsfrWWv9m89oVD3TWYKvfesqRoBNNjzyqml"

The beef processors and the big supermarkets make millions in profits each year – and they don’t want to pay their workers properly or give a decent price to the farmers who supply their meat.

For every €10 spent on buying meat, 

the supermarket chains get €5.10
the beef processors get €2.90
the farmers get €2.00

The beef processors have accumulated €3 billion in profits while ABP alone has made €175 million in profit last year. ABP is also one of Ireland’s leading tax dodgers – using a company in Luxembourg to help reduce its tax bill.

In order to break the farmers protests, the big meat companies have tried to go to the courts to get an injunction to stop protests at their plants.

Usually these injunctions are hand out like confetti by judges who are linked to the political establishment. So, it was no surprise that an injunction was issued against protesting farmers.

But, in a singular act of courage, the farmers have defied these injunctions. They have stood up for their rights – and they have been correct to do so.

This explains the latest tactics of the meat industry – they are laying off workers to try to turn them against the farmers and to put pressure on the government.

No one should fall for this trap.

The beef bosses can afford to pay a decent price to farees – and keep paying the wages of workers.

We need unity between the farmers and workers to take on the beef barons.

We need to take these companies into public ownership – so that we can shift policy on how meat is produced. 

Public ownership can guarantee decent prices for farmers, proper wages for workers – and it can start a just transition that allows small farmers to start moving out of beef in order to reflect changes needed to protect our planet from climate change.","265","https://www.facebook.com/peoplebeforeprofitofficial/posts/pfbid029AKcQn6qDaS9yFKRY6feRpnLPzVcFfF3SVPAWcqvhZ2yYEpQdagEXrsWqJqzQz8ol"

The Fianna Party leader, Michael Martin, has been making efforts to give his party a more modern, liberal look. But it is a bit like fake tan – it easily comes off.

A recent debate on the Carlow County Council showed the real culture of the party
.
Fianna Fail Councillor Arthur McDonald tried to play to the  anti-traveller audience by claiming that ‘crime rate goes up by 30%’ around the time of the Borris Fair every year.

There was not a shred of evidence to back his racist claim and People Before Profit councillor, Adrienne Wallace challenged him to withdraw his remark.

Clearly unused to be challenged by a young female councillor, McDonald responded by telling her to ‘shut her mouth’

Cllr Wallace said on Tuesday that the comments reveal ""an embedded sexism within Fianna Fáil – numerous councillors entered the debate but I was the only person who was spoken to in such a derogatory manner"".

""That language should not be tolerated in any work place. Fianna Fáil consistently struggle to meet gender quotas and now I’m not surprised as to why,"" she added.","120","https://www.facebook.com/peoplebeforeprofitofficial/posts/pfbid0pwc2PmHYKG1VUFKL1xmi9WVjqBMcch28JqRuwodwMZ4KgAtHNRkcWS8xEdwSMJvFl"
